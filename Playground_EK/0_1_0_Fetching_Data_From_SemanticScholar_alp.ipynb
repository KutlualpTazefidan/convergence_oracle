Quite recently a new measure of this kind has been proposed, which in the opinion of many promises to rank with house sanitation and preventive inoculation as a means of saving human life on a large scale. Unfortunately, its value has not yet been clearly demonstrated, with the result that it is not being employed as largely as some of us hoped would be the case. I feel, therefore, that I cannot better acknowledge the honour you have done me in inviting me to address you to-day than by attempting to discuss this important theme, in the hope that the discussion may prove profitable to the cause of public health. The new sanitary policy to which I refer is that which aims at the reduction of disease-bearing insects, especially those which are the disseminating agents of malaria, yellow fever, and filariasis. I presume that it is searcely necessary to discuss the evidence which has established the connexion between various insects and arthropeds and many diseases of man and of animals. The fact that the pathogenetic parasites which produce thoese great scourges of the tropics just mentioned are carried by gnats is now too well known to require reiteration. It is necessary only to remind you that the gnat acts as an intermediary, becoming infected when biting infected persons, and some weeks later infecting healthy persons inits turn-the parasite passing alternately from insect to man. The hypothesis that the infection in these diseases may be produced in any other manner than by the bite of gnats has not been justified by any recorded experiments or by any substantial arguments, and we may therefore assume for the present that if we could exterminate the intermediary agents, the gnats, in a locality, we could also exterminate there the diseases referred to. But here we enter upon ground which in the opinion of many is much less secure. While some believe in the possibility of reducing gnats in given localities and consider that the pointhas been proved by experiment, others are much more sceptical and hold that the experiments were not sound. This state of uncertainty naturally causes much hesitation in the adoption of measures against gnats, and therefore possibly a continued loss of life by the diseases occasioned by them, and I therefore propose to sift the matter as carefully as time will allow. In the first place, we should note that experlments made in this connexion have not been very satisfactory, owing to the fact that no accurate method has yet been found for estimating the number of gnats in any locality.

Paul C. StandlEy, U. S. National Museum.^ While working with the woody plants of Mexico, the writer has segregated from time to time from the undetermined Mexican plants in the National Herbarium a rather large number of sheets which evidently belonged to one genus. The specimens come from many widely separated localities, and although of rather characteristic general appearance, it is remarkable to find that none has ever been named generically or even referred to a family. Recently the writer determined that one of the forms had been named by DeCandolle, who applied the name SchaeJJeria racemosa, basing his description upon one of Sesse and Mocino's sketches of Mexican plants. It was evident, however, that the plant had nothing in common with the genus Schaefferia, which belongs to the family Celastraceae. Careful examination of the Mexican material and comparison with the herbarium specimens available show that the former belong to the genus Agonandra, a member of the family Opiliaceae. Neither the genus nor the family has been reported heretofore from North America. Only one species of Agonandra has been described, a native of Brazil and Colombia, and it has been the only known American representative of the family, the other\", \"year\": 1904, \"citationCount\": 5, \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"103726029\", \"name\": \"J.

The basic principle in Mendel's discoveries is that of the purity of t. he germcells; in accordance with this a cross-bred animal or plant produces germ-cells bearing only one of each pair of characters in which its parents differ. From it follows the occurrence in the second and later hybrid generations of a definite number of forms in definite numerical proportions. 2. Mendel's principle of dominance is realized in the heredity of a considerable number of characters among both animals and plants. In accordance with this principle, hybrid offspring have visibly the character of only one parent or the other, though they transmit those of both parents. 3. In other cases the hybrid has a distinctive character of its own. This may approximate more or less closely the character of one parent or the other, or it may be entirely different from both. Frequently the distinctive hybrid character resembles a lost ancestral character. In some cases of this sort, as in coat-color of mammals, the hybrid character probably results from a recomibination of the characters seen in one or both parents, with certain Other characters latent (that is, recessive) in one parent or the other. 4. There have been observed the following exceptions to the principle of dominance, or to the principle of purity of the germ-cells, or to both: (a) Mosaic inheritance, in which a pair of characters ordinarily related as dominant and recessive occur in a balanced relationship, side by side in the hybrid individual and frequently in its germ-cells also. This balanced condition, once obtained, is usually stable under close breeding, but is readily disturbed by cross-breeding, giving place then to the normal dominance. (b) Stable (self-perpetuating) hybrid forms result from certain crosses. These constitute an exception to both the law of dominance and to that of purity of the germ-cells. For the hybrid is like neither parent, but the characters of both parents exist in a stable union in the mature germcells produced by the hybrid. (c) Coupling, i. e., complete correlation may exist between two or more characters, so that they form a compound unit not separable in heredity, at least in certain crosses. (d) Disintegration of characters apparently simple may take place in consequence of cross-breeding. (e) Departures from the expected ratios of dominants to recessives may be explained in some cases as due to inferior vigor, and so greater mortality, on the part of dominants or recessives respectively. (f) Cases of apparent reversal of dominance may arise from \\u2019false hybridization\\u2018 (induced lparthenogenesis). Possibly in other cases the determination of dominance rests with circumstances as yet unknown. 5. Mendel's principles strengthen the view that species arise by discontinuous variation.
