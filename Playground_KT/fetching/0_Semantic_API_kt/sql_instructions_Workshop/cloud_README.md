# PostgreSQL Table Creation, Data Loading, and Database Dumping Exercise

This exercise demonstrates how to create tables in PostgreSQL, load data into them from CSV files, and perform a database dump. We'll cover the following steps:

1. **Setting Up PostgreSQL**
   - Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.

2. **Creating the Database**
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database or use an existing one.

3. **Creating Tables**
   - Create tables to hold the data. In this exercise, we create three tables: "saffron," "food," and "saffron_orders."

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Prepare CSV files containing the data you want to insert into the tables:
     - `saffron_queries.csv` for saffron-related data.
     - `saffron_foods.csv` for food-related data.
     - `saffron_orders.csv` for saffron orders data.
     - `saffron_preferences.csv` for saffron food preferences

5. **Inserting Data**
   - Use the `COPY` command to insert data from the CSV files into the respective tables. We provide SQL commands for each table:
     - Insert data into the "saffron" table.
     - Insert data into the "saffron_food" table.
     - Insert data into the "saffron_orders" table.
     - Insert data into the "saffron_preferences" table.
6. **Database Dumping**
   - Learn how to perform a database dump to create a backup of the entire database.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to complete the exercise:

1. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Create a new database or use an existing one.

2. **Table Creation**
   - Run the SQL commands to create the necessary tables:
     - "saffron" table: Contains saffron-related data.
     - "saffron_food" table: Contains food-related data.
     - "saffron_orders" table: Records saffron orders.
     - "saffron_preferences" table: Records saffron food preferences.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Prepare CSV files (`saffron_queries.csv`, `saffron_foods.csv`, `saffron_orders.csv`, and `saffron_preferences.csv`) with the data you want to insert into the tables.

4. **Data Insertion**
   - Use the `\COPY` command to insert data into the tables from the CSV files:
     - Insert data into the "saffron" table with `\COPY`.
     - Insert data into the "food" table with `\COPY`.
     - Insert data into the "saffron_orders" table with `\COPY`.
     - Insert data into the "saffron_prederences" table with `\COPY`.

5. **Database Dump**
   - To create a backup (dump) of the entire database, you can use the `pg_dump` command. Run the following command in your terminal:
   
     ```
     pg_dump -U your_username -d your_database_name -f database_dump.sql
     ```

     Replace `your_username` with your PostgreSQL username and `your_database_name` with the name of your database. The `-f` option specifies the output file where the dump will be saved.
