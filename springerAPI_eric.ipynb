Substantial rearchitecting will be necessary to allow proper functioning of a highly-diversified space-air-ground-sea physical infrastructure, along with operation at frequency ranges spanning from sub-GHz, to millimeter-waves (mm-Waves), again to sub-THz (100–300 GHz) and above. In this work, we focus on the radio frequency (RF) portion of the infrastructure, and in particular on micro-relays for channel commuting and reconfiguration of passive elements. To this end, we report on high-performance and highly-miniaturized micro-switches based on microelectromechanical-systems (MEMS) technology, known as RF-MEMS. A few different design concepts of RF-MEMS-based series ohmic switches are reported, discussed and compared, with the support of finite element method (FEM) modeling and RF experimental characterization up to 110 GHz.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The lightning-fast development of artificial intelligence and neural networks in general has had a tremendous impact on many different fields, and biological engineering is only one of those fields. These innovations have the potential to completely revolutionize the field of medicine by enhancing diagnostics, treatment planning, and tailored medication. This might be accomplished. However, there are ethical and legal concerns about the manner in which they should be incorporated into biomedicine. This study's objective is to investigate the existing legal frameworks that regulate the uses of artificial intelligence and neural networks in biomedical engineering and to evaluate how effectively such frameworks address the challenges posed by technological inclusion. On a global, regional, and national basis, we evaluated the rules and regulations that regulate the use of artificial intelligence and neural networks in biomedical engineering. These laws and regulations control the field. According to the findings of our research, even if the current legal frameworks have been improved in some respects, substantial problems are still present. These problems are particularly prevalent in the areas of data privacy, algorithmic responsibility, and ethical dilemmas. Also, the article discusses the need of doing ongoing evaluations and making adjustments in order to keep up with the fast advancement of artificial intelligence and neural networks in the area of biomedical engineering.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Flexible manufacturing systems in high-mix low-volume segments offer many challenges in terms of planning and scheduling. The complexity of these systems often requires a systemic approach for which humans are the perfect actors. However, computer systems can support scheduling tasks more effectively due to their capacity to synthesize large amounts of data. This paper describes a system developed for the flexible manufacturing of wooden doors with a wide range of product configurations. This paper proposes a rule-based scheduling method for high-mix production. The method was applied and validated at a wooden door producer. Based on the company's production schedule for a given week, a scheduling program was developed that suggested minor rearrangements for production leveling. As the rule-based approach makes the decisions verifiable, the program was validated at the producer, through a case study of production leveling under volume constraints. The results include the complete elimination of changeovers and the stabilization of throughput, which improved the precision of the delivery time. The producer is integrating the program into their production planning and control system. Thus, the results suggest that the proposed method can be useful for scheduling high-mix low-volume production, and merits further validation in similar environments.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Due to the demographic developments of an increasingly aging society, the number of employees retiring is also rising. Likewise, the fluctuation within the individual companies has increased drastically within the last few years. As a result, experience gained over many years is being lost. On the other hand, there is a strong trend towards an ever-increasing number of very complex manufacturing processes with a large number of process influencing variables, where the human monitoring capabilities are limited. In this work we study the complex process of hot stamping of metal blanks for car body parts with a demonstrator plant. The demonstrator plant consists of five main components, comprising a magazine for material feed, an industrial robot for transferring the raw material and the finished part, an annealing furnace, and a hydraulic press with the temperature controlled hot forming tool inside. All machines have open communication interfaces with which all sensor data can be accessed. The demonstrator plant is additionally outfitted with different sensors measuring crucial process parameters. We use temperature sensors in the punch and die and make use of capturing the structure-borne sound and mechanical vibrations during the process to closely monitor the process. This sensor data is analyzed and methods of machine learning are used to detect anomalies in the process data. The goal of this work is to develop a methodology for the systematic detection of anomalies in the hot forming process using machine learning methods within a demonstrator plant that are suitable for real time anomaly detection for a high level control system. We use unsupervised machine learning techniques and neural networks to detect anomalies with great accuracy on our test data.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

They are used in many industries to interact with customers, respond to frequently asked inquiries, and carry out specific duties for which they were designed. More AI enabled chatbots are being used in the tourism industry to provide better customer service to the travellers. In the literature review, researches relating to adoption of AI chatbots in tourism are scarce. The paper extends the UTAUT2 model and examines the aspects that impact consumer adoption of AI chatbots in the travel and tourism segment. We used a quantitative research approach and the data was collected through online surveys. A total of 466 responses were collected from frequent travellers. Partial least square approach was utilized to do the data analysis. The emanating outcome of this research study divulge the aspects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, habit, personal innovativeness, and awareness of chatbot service optimistically influenced the behavioural intention to make use of AI chatbots for tourism services. Awareness of service also indirectly influenced intention to use through performance and effort expectancies.

The integration of data between BIM models and IoT devices enables the creation of Digital Twins (DTs) of built heritage assets, capable of connecting data coming continuously from sensors with digital models of those assets. This enables the management of large masses of data produced at various stages of the building lifecycle, making it possible to experiment with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics for predictive analysis of building system behavior and performance. This paper presents the results of a research, which aimed to develop a methodological and operational workflow for the creation of Digital Twin of buildings. The interoperability offered by the IFC schema allowed the use of an external platform for linking different semantic fields. Thus, on the one hand, a federated BIM model was created, and on the other hand, real-time acquired data from a system of sensors in-stalled at different locations in the building were recorded and stored in a central server.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The recent COVID-19 pandemic has served as a timely reminder that the existing drug discovery is a laborious, expensive, and slow process. Never has there been such global demand for a therapeutic treatment to be identified as a matter of such urgency. Unfortunately, this is a scenario likely to repeat itself in future, so it is of interest to explore ways in which to accelerate drug discovery at pandemic speed. Computational methods naturally lend themselves to this because they can be performed rapidly if sufficient computational resources are available. Recently, high-performance computing (HPC) technologies have led to remarkable achievements in computational drug discovery and yielded a series of new platforms, algorithms, and workflows. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches is also a promising and relatively new avenue to revolutionize the drug design process and therefore reduce costs. In this review, I describe how molecular dynamics simulations (MD) were successfully integrated with ML and adapted to HPC to form a powerful tool to study inhibitors for four of the COVID-19 target proteins. The emphasis of this review is on the strategy that was used with an explanation of each of the steps in the accelerated drug discovery workflow.

The multi-national companies were able to quickly adapt and cope with changing times, but the micro small-scale enterprises (m-SMEs) were at crossroads to adopt new technology due to extensive costs involved. This gap of no existing solutions for micro-SMEs is the result of literature survey for this work. Then the COVID-19 pandemic made it extremely difficult for micro-SMEs to survive. This paper implements a smart manufacturing solution for production facility at one such micro-SME. Pre-pandemic, their facility had enough production to satisfy the demand, but pandemic overwhelmed their production with rapid rise in demand. The main goal for this study is to make the micro-SME cope this unprecedented rise in demand. The production facility was upgraded, and smart features were incorporated based on cyber-physical production systems framework to predict demand and transform a manual manufacturing into smart manufacturing. With more than one product being produced, optimum production was achieved avoiding over/underproduction for different products given the limited storage capacity available with the micro-SMEs.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

Artificial intelligence technology has a deep impact on different disciplines and can improve the efficiency of architectural skin design and inspire architects. In order to find new expressions of the building skin, it is necessary to focus on the dialogue between the architectural skin and the environment, and to innovate by breaking away from the patterned and formalized design. This work combines the development of artificial intelligence to initially explore the role of neural style transfer for architectural skin design, where the fusion of different styles of architectural images is programmed to generate another style, thus allowing architects to make clearer decisions and judgments. After performing neural style migration on five different types of buildings, the results obtained can present the new style form more completely, which provides new ideas and inspiration for the application of artificial intelligence in architectural design.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Brazil, despite its recent advances in the regulatory sphere for Privacy and Data Protection, still remains unregulated regarding the use of artificial intelligence. In 2020, two years after the enactment of the General Law on Data Protection (LGPD), a Bill emerged that was the first Brazilian attempt not only to regulate, but also to define, classify, and identify AI-powered tools. However, among confusing meanings and vague typifications, the proposal failed to become the prototype that would generate a regulatory framework that encompasses both preventive compliance methods and possible remedial solutions for eventual disputes. Thus, the need emerges to seek pre-existing solutions in the Brazilian legislation that, although still undefined and precariously implemented, may be consolidated in the future as indispensable tools for the identification of eventual failures. This is where the mandatory implementation of the impact assessment comes in as a potential solution for the detailed analysis of AI-powered systems. Software architectures that are programmed to make automated decisions by means of machine learning techniques, for example, present certain risks, but the level of risk is unknown, precisely because of the lack of transparency about how their internal architectures work. Thus, a continuous and properly documented risk assessment will provide essential analysis both to substantiate a preventive system that survives the wear and tear of time in relation to inexorable technological advancement, and to serve as a broad and precise regulation, which will work as a legal instrument for any legal dispute that may arise in the years to come.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The advancements in artificial intelligence are triggering discussions on transforming many processes in the industry, society or economy, including the healthcare sector. The new capabilities offered by emerging technologies applied in healthcare help deliver more accurate and efficient diagnoses and treatment options. Artificial intelligence models can be used for various purposes in healthcare, from functions such as personal assistant, up to analyzing data and providing recommendations for tasks such as medical imaging analysis, drug development, disease identification, and emergency support. Furthermore, artificial intelligence models can support research actions, to speed up the development of certain cures or medicines. They can also assist in detecting high-risk conditions in patients, discovering and researching new drugs and medicines, and developing new treatment plans. However, these digital technologies come with cybersecurity risks, both due to the underlying technical systems, such as computers used, up to the risks or issues in the models themselves, which can lead to questions on the accuracy of the recommendations and solutions provided by the models, or data breaches and cyber-attacks. Such incidents can lead to serious consequences, including compromised data privacy and safety. This paper presents some potential use cases of the AI model in the healthcare industry. In addition, several cyber security recommendations are offered to ensure that the adoption and use of such emerging tools minimize potential cyber risks.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>It is a challenging task to teach machines to paint like human artists in a stroke-by-stroke fashion. Despite advances in stroke-based image rendering and deep learning-based image rendering, existing painting methods have limitations: they (i) lack flexibility to choose different art-style strokes, (ii) lose content details of images, and (iii) generate few artistic styles for paintings. In this paper, we propose a stroke-style generative adversarial network, called Stroke-GAN, to solve the first two limitations. Stroke-GAN learns styles of strokes from different stroke-style datasets, so can produce diverse stroke styles. We design three players in Stroke-GAN to generate pure-color strokes close to human artists’ strokes, thereby improving the quality of painted details. To overcome the third limitation, we have devised a neural network named Stroke-GAN Painter, based on Stroke-GAN; it can generate different artistic styles of paintings. Experiments demonstrate that our artful painter can generate various styles of paintings while well-preserving content details (such as details of human faces and building textures) and retaining high fidelity to the input images.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The challenges associated with diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease (CVD)/Stroke in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) arise from the delayed onset of symptoms. Existing clinical risk scores are inadequate in predicting cardiac events, and conventional risk factors alone do not accurately classify many individuals at risk. Several CVD biomarkers consider the multiple pathways involved in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the primary cause of CVD/Stroke in RA. To enhance the accuracy of CVD/Stroke risk assessment in the RA framework, a proposed approach involves combining genomic-based biomarkers (GBBM) derived from plasma and/or serum samples with innovative non-invasive radiomic-based biomarkers (RBBM), such as measurements of synovial fluid, plaque area, and plaque burden. This review presents two hypotheses: (i) RBBM and GBBM biomarkers exhibit a significant correlation and can precisely detect the severity of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based preventive, precision, and personalized (aiP<superscript>3</superscript>) CVD/Stroke risk AtheroEdge™ model (AtheroPoint™, CA, USA) that utilizes deep learning (DL) to accurately classify the risk of CVD/stroke in RA framework. The authors conducted a comprehensive search using the PRISMA technique, identifying 153 studies that assessed the features/biomarkers of RBBM and GBBM for CVD/Stroke. The study demonstrates how DL models can be integrated into the AtheroEdge™–aiP<superscript>3</superscript> framework to determine the risk of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. The findings of this review suggest that the combination of RBBM with GBBM introduces a new dimension to the assessment of CVD/Stroke risk in the RA framework. Synovial fluid levels that are higher than normal lead to an increase in the plaque burden. Additionally, the review provides recommendations for novel, unbiased, and pruned DL algorithms that can predict CVD/Stroke risk within a RA framework that is preventive, precise, and personalized.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Medical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have consistently shown remarkable performance in providing medical professionals and patients with support for complex tasks. Nevertheless, the use of these applications in sensitive clinical domains where high-stakes decisions are involved could be much more extensive if patients, medical professionals, and regulators were provided with mechanisms for trusting the results provided by AI systems. A key issue for achieving this is endowing AI systems with key dimensions of Trustworthy AI (TAI), such as fairness, transparency, robustness, or accountability, which are not usually considered within this context in a generalized and systematic manner. This paper reviews the recent advances in the TAI domain, including TAI standards and guidelines. We propose several requirements to be addressed in the design, development, and deployment of TAI systems and present a novel machine learning pipeline that contains TAI requirements as embedded components. Moreover, as an example of how current AI systems in medicine consider the TAI perspective, the study extensively reviews the recent literature (2017–2021) on AI systems in a prevalent and high social-impact disease: diagnosis and progression detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The most relevant AI systems in the AD domain are compared and discussed (such as machine learning, deep learning, ensembles, time series, and multimodal multitask) from the perspective of how they address TAI in their design. Several open challenges are highlighted, which could be claimed as one of the main reasons to justify the rare application of AI systems in real clinical environments. The study provides a roadmap to measure the TAI status of an AI systems and highlights its limitations. In addition, it provides the main guidelines to overcome these limitations and build medically trusted AI-based applications in the medical domain.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>This article considers current advances in tattooing that are challenging community-held views of authorship and ownership, and the need to address this tension. The key challenge is from AI-generated artworks being used as tattoo designs, but the authorial role of the tattooist is also challenged by body art projects such as tattoo collection. Legal clarity for tattooing is lacking, and in addressing this, this article advocates for an open, community-based form of shared copyright ownership and authorship for projects as tattoo collecting, drawing on Dusollier’s and Mendis’ work. This article contributes to both copyright and cultural heritage legal scholarship, and to tattooing scholarship and the tattooing community. AI-generated art being tattooed on people has not been explored in the literature to date, and this article fills this gap. Furthermore, this article contributes a pilot study of the tattoo community’s views on AI-generated tattoos, which is currently lacking from the scholarly debate on AI-generated art. This article argues that the debate within the tattoo community about AI-generated art being used in tattoos needs to be addressed within the community through agreed extra-legal norms, which may well depart from how copyright law decides to approach AI-generated art globally.

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Stock market’s volatile and complex nature makes it difficult to predict the market situation. Deep Learning is capable of simulating and analyzing complex patterns in unstructured data. Deep learning models have applications in image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and many more. Its application in stock market prediction is gaining attention because of its capacity to handle large datasets and data mapping with accurate prediction. However, most methods ignore the impact of mass media on the company’s stock and investors’ behaviours. This work proposes a hybrid deep learning model combining Word2Vec and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. The main objective is to design an intelligent tool to forecast the directional movement of stock market prices based on financial time series and news headlines as inputs. The binary predicted output obtained using the proposed model would aid investors in making better decisions. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed in terms of accuracy of the prediction of directional movement of stock prices of five companies from different sectors of operation.\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The aim of our study is to validate a totally automated deep learning (DL)-based segmentation pipeline to screen abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans. We retrospectively evaluated 73 thoraco-abdominal CTAs (48 AAA and 25 control CTA) by means of a DL-based segmentation pipeline built on a 2.5D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to segment lumen and thrombus of the aorta. The maximum aortic diameter of the abdominal tract was compared using a threshold value (30 mm). Blinded manual measurements from a radiologist were done in order to create a true comparison. The screening pipeline was tested on 48 patients with aneurysm and 25 without aneurysm. The average diameter manually measured was 51.1 ± 14.4 mm for patients with aneurysms and 21.7 ± 3.6 mm for patients without aneurysms. The pipeline correctly classified 47 AAA out of 48 and 24 control patients out of 25 with 97% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 96% specificity. The automated pipeline of aneurysm measurements in the abdominal tract reported a median error with regard to the maximum abdominal diameter measurement of 1.3 mm. Our approach allowed for the maximum diameter of 51.2 ± 14.3 mm in patients with aneurysm and 22.0 ± 4.0 mm in patients without an aneurysm. The DL-based screening for AAA is a feasible and accurate method, calling for further validation using a larger pool of diagnostic images towards its clinical use.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Google’s Bard has emerged as a formidable competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT in the field of conversational AI. Notably, Bard has recently been updated to handle visual inputs alongside text prompts during conversations. Given Bard’s impressive track record in handling textual inputs, we explore its capabilities in understanding and interpreting visual data (images) conditioned by text questions. This exploration holds the potential to unveil new insights and challenges for Bard and other forthcoming multi-modal Generative models, especially in addressing complex computer vision problems that demand accurate visual and language understanding. Specifically, in this study, we focus on 15 diverse task scenarios encompassing regular, camouflaged, medical, under-water and remote sensing data to comprehensively evaluate Bard’s performance. Our primary finding indicates that Bard still struggles in these vision scenarios, highlighting the significant gap in vision-based understanding that needs to be bridged in future developments. We expect that this empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, leading to enhanced capabilities in comprehending and interpreting fine-grained visual data.

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection literature clearly defines semantic shift as a sign of OOD but does not have a consensus over covariate shift. Samples experiencing covariate shift but not semantic shift from the in-distribution (ID) are either excluded from the test set or treated as OOD, which contradicts the primary goal in machine learning—being able to generalize beyond the training distribution. In this paper, we take into account both shift types and introduce full-spectrum OOD (F-OOD) detection, a more realistic problem setting that considers both detecting semantic shift and being tolerant to covariate shift; and design three benchmarks. These new benchmarks have a more fine-grained categorization of distributions (<emphasis type=\"Italic\">i.e</emphasis>let@tokeneonedot, training ID, covariate-shifted ID, near-OOD, and far-OOD) for the purpose of more comprehensively evaluating the pros and cons of algorithms. To address the F-OOD detection problem, we propose SEM, a simple feature-based semantics score function. SEM is mainly composed of two probability measures: one is based on high-level features containing both semantic and non-semantic information, while the other is based on low-level feature statistics only capturing non-semantic image styles. With a simple combination, the non-semantic part is canceled out, which leaves only semantic information in SEM that can better handle F-OOD detection. Extensive experiments on the three new benchmarks show that SEM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Our code and benchmarks are released in <externalref>\n",

Generative AI models have garnered significant attention for their potential in educational settings, but image-generative AI models need to be more utilized. This study explores the potential of integrating generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, into art-focused STEAM classes. To this end, we combined STEAM education with image-generative AI. We designed and implemented a learning activity in which students used image-generative AI to generate creative images and wrote imaginative diaries inspired by AI-generated pictures. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected and analyzed data from surveys, interviews, and prompt datasets to gain insights into students' perceptions, motivations, and behaviors concerning the integration of generative AI in art education. Our study found that incorporating generative AI into art-focused STEAM classes may reduce the gap between male and female students' interest in art practices. We also found that the number of subjects in students' prompt datasets is linked to their divergent and convergent thinking. Finally, we discovered a meaningful correlation between the number of unique words in students' diaries and the image scores that researchers assessed. Our findings shed light on the relationship between students' divergent and convergent behaviors, offering valuable insights into their creative thinking processes.

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Much more than their machinic reality, current iterations of AI rely on imagined divisions of human and non-human properties and skills that have genealogical ties to colonization. For this reason, research efforts have recently been made to historicize these imaginaries, connecting them to colonial ideals that delegate black and brown colonized people into the realm of the non-human. Atanasoski and Vora (Surrogate humanity. Race, robots and the politics of technological futures, Duke, Durham and London, 2019) have called this a “surrogate humanity”, where narratives of autonomous technologies function to disappear precisely the formerly colonized peoples that are enveloped in its production process. At the same time, the gendered and racialized roots of this maternal figure represents an opportunity to uncover and critique the invisibilization of embodied resources necessary to produce AI, precarious bodies labouring to produce algorithmic infrastructures in a manner that can be considered in a genealogy of carework and reproduction. These genealogies complicate the detachment suggested by the surrogate figure and go beyond it to proclaim a more generative function of the relationship between the black maternal figure and AI. The article analyses Tabita Rezaire’s multi-media artwork <emphasis type=\"Italic\">Sugar Walls Teardom</emphasis> to think through decolonial and queer renderings of the black female bodies upon which technological imaginaries rest, to extend beyond AI surrogacy and towards notions of kinship, care and world-making by producing an AI aesthetics that is relational, embodied, and celebratory of other ways of liveness.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>This paper proposes a Reconfigurable In-Memory Advance Computing architecture using a novel 10 SRAM cell. In addition to basic logic operations, the proposed R-InMAC can also implement complex Boolean computing operations such as binary addition/subtraction, binary-to-gray, gray-to-binary conversion, 2’s complement, less/greater than, and increment/decrement. Furthermore, content addressable memory (CAM) operation to search a binary string in a memory array is also proposed efficiently. It can search true and complementary data strings in a single cycle. The proposed R-InMAC architecture’s reconfigurability allows it to be configured according to the needed operation and bit precision, making it ideal and energy-efficient. In addition, compared to the standard SRAM cells, the proposed 10T cell is suited for implementing the XNOR-based binary convolution operation required in Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) with improved latency of 58.89%. The optimized full adder of the proposed R-InMAC shows decrement in the area by 40%, static power by 28%, dynamic power by 55.2%, and latency by 25.3% as compared to conventional designs, making this work a promising candidate for modern edge AI compute in-memory systems.\n",

Therefore, the study defines first a comprehensive typology of port stakeholders' challenges, which can be solved via AI solutions. This typology presents challenges, including their main issues, widespread impact, and potential solutions. A state-of-the-art review of AI solutions that can address these challenges is carried out in parallel. Secondly, this review clearly distinguishes between AI solutions based on their technology and functionality. Thirdly, this research selects an appropriate AI solution for addressing each identified challenge in the port operation by upgrading the Gale–Shapley algorithm. Finally, it shows that the most critical presented AI solutions in this study use various machine learning (ML) techniques. Besides, concerning the AI solution's reusability feature and the result of high-level matching, this research shows that the implementation phase effort can be drastically reduced by using the recently developed matching algorithm.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Singularitarianism is a view that is grounded in certain claims about the technological singularity. In this paper, I identify a trilemma that confronts singularitarianism. This trilemma may be characterized in terms of the following horns: the concept of a technological singularity having a literal sense, the concept of a technological singularity having a metaphorical sense, and the concept of a technological singularity having neither a literal nor a metaphorical sense (i.e., its being nonsensical). I will outline the unpalatable consequences that are associated with each of these three horns of the trilemma. I will also anticipate a few argumentative moves on behalf of singularitarianism and suggest why these moves may be insufficient. I will conclude by arguing that we have good philosophical grounds to defend an eliminativism about the concept of the technological singularity.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>One of the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 is to keep the unemployment rate at the lowest level to empower the economy. Prior research has shown that an increase in unemployment has a negative effect on a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This paper aims to utilise cutting-edge technology such as Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist the Saudi labour market by matching job seekers with vacant positions. Currently, human experts carry out this process; however, this is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Moreover, in the Saudi labour market, this process does not use a cohesive data centre to monitor, integrate or analyse labour-market data, resulting in several inefficiencies, such as bias and latency. These inefficiencies arise from a lack of technologies and, more importantly, from having an open labour-market without a national data centre. This paper proposes a new AI Recruiting Model (AIRM) architecture that exploits DLs, ML and AI to rapidly and efficiently match job seekers to vacant positions in the Saudi labour market. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is employed to test the proposed AIRM architecture using a labour market dataset simulation corpus for training purposes; the architecture is further evaluated against three research collaborators who are all professionals in Human Resources (HR). As this research is data-driven in nature, it requires collaboration from domain experts. The first layer of the AIRM architecture uses balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH) as a clustering algorithm for the initial screening layer. The mapping layer uses sentence transformers with a robustly optimised BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) as the base model, and ranking is carried out using the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). Finally, the preferences layer takes the user’s preferences as a list and sorts the results using the pre-trained cross-encoders model, considering the weight of the more important words. This new AIRM has yielded favourable outcomes: This research considered accepting an AIRM selection ratified by at least one HR expert to account for the subjective character of the selection process when exclusively handled by human HR experts. The research evaluated the AIRM using two metrics: accuracy and time. The AIRM had an overall matching accuracy of 84%, with at least one expert agreeing with the system’s output. Furthermore, it completed the task in 2.4 min, whereas human experts took more than 6 days on average. Overall, the AIRM outperforms humans in task execution, making it useful in pre-selecting a group of applicants and positions. The AIRM is not limited to government services. It can also help any commercial business that uses Big Data.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

Studying public opinions about wildfires can help monitor the perception of the impacted communities. Nevertheless, wildfire research is relatively limited compared to other climate-related hazards. This article presents our data mining work on public opinions about wildfires in Australia from 2014 to 2021. Three key aspects are analyzed: the topic of concern, sentiment polarization, and perceived emotions. We propose a data filtering approach to acquire golden samples to train a supervised model for emotion quantification to achieve the last target. The results show that the new model produces a more accurate emotion estimation than the existing lexicon approach. Through data analysis, we find that people have seen wildfires as one of the impacts of climate change; trends of tweets can reflect the damage of wildfires in real life.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Personality describes an individual’s internal attributes, encompassing distinctive thoughts, emotions, and behaviour. Various studies have been undertaken to quantify these personality traits using externally visible cues and measures. Despite the possibility of a disparity between the apparent and real personality traits, researchers have identified various deep learning techniques to measure the apparent personality as part of the ChaLearn Looking at People, ECCV challenge. We provide an overview of the different deep learning models used for apparent personality detection. The primary objective of previous studies was to develop highly accurate prediction models, and subsequently, the focus shifted towards interpreting the output of these techniques. Although explainable AI (XAI) techniques have shown that facial features are essential in predicting personality, the consistency of these results is still a critical factor to consider. Moreover, the majority of studies utilized the ECCV challenge CVPR’17 dataset to predict apparent personality; therefore, there is a requirement to validate these findings through additional datasets. In conclusion, ample scope exists for further research in the domain of personality detection that can yield highly accurate and more interpretable models.\n",

However, when humans evaluate creativity, their judgment is clouded by biases triggered by the characteristics of the creator. Drawing from folk psychology and algorithm aversion research, we examine whether the identity of the producer of a given artifact as artificial intelligence (AI) or human is a source of bias affecting people’s creativity evaluation of such artifact and what drives this effect. With four experimental studies (<emphasis type=\"Italic\">N</emphasis> = 2039), of which two were pre-registered, using different experimental designs and evaluation targets, we found that people sometimes—but not always—ascribe lower creativity to a product when they are told that the producer is an AI rather than a human. In addition, we found that people consistently perceive generative AI to exert less effort than humans in the creation of a given artifact, which drives the lower creativity ratings ascribed to generative AI producers. We discuss the implication of these findings for organizational creativity and innovation in the context of human-AI interaction.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

However, they provide little support for explaining why images were placed together or apart in the 2D space. Additionally, they do not provide support for modifying and updating the 2D representation to explore new relationships and organizations of images. To address these problems, we present an interactive DR method for images that uses visual features extracted by a deep neural network to project the images into 2D space and provides visual explanations of image features that contributed to the 2D location. In addition, it allows people to directly manipulate the 2D projection space to define alternative relationships and explore subsequent projections of the images. With an iterative cycle of semantic interaction and explainable-AI feedback, people can explore complex visual relationships in image data. Our approach to human–AI interaction integrates visual knowledge from both human-mental models and pre-trained deep neural models to explore image data. We demonstrate our method through examples with collaborators in agricultural science and other applications. Additionally, we present a quantitative evaluation that assesses how well our method captures and incorporates feedback.\n",

Recommender systems are one example of systems that great efforts have been conducted to make their output more explainable. One method for producing a more explainable output is using counterfactual reasoning, which involves altering minimal features to generate a counterfactual item that results in changing the output of the system. This process allows the identification of input features that have a significant impact on the desired output, leading to effective explanations.

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Social media has revolutionized the way information is distributed throughout society, as folks continue to rely entirely on these apps for information on current events, health protocols, and socio-political discussions. However, these containers of knowledge do not appear in the same shape for every user; Algorithms, informed by capitalist agendas, determine what information sifts through its networks and to whom. Data scientists, researchers, and activists have dissected the hidden mechanics fueling these popular platforms, inciting critical conversations around the harmful biases embedded in algorithms. These studies often skim the surface of how these algorithms digitally marginalize people of color, if acknowledging it at all. Even fewer have attempted to examine the role these algorithms play in the social activism and digital community organizing happening amongst communities of color via social media. Referring to indigenous scholar Marisa Elena Duarte’s book Network Sovereignty as a framework of thought, this paper roots itself in the notion that technology is an extension of the agenda utilizing it. Through dissecting the algorithmic structures of popular social platforms among communities of color, this paper examines how social media distributes information within its networks and how its encoded biases silence Black, brown, and indigenous voices. This paper also provides insight into how BIPOC content-creators, when informed on how the algorithms work, can use these platforms to their advantage and effectively facilitate socio-political discourse online; Changing the narrative of social networks from being yet another landscape of white supremacy to instead a communal canvas for radical change.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The term ‘artificial intelligence’ has arguably come to function in political discourse as, what Laclau called, an ‘empty signifier’. This article traces the shifting political discourse on AI within three key institutions of global governance–OHCHR, WHO, and UNESCO–and, in so doing, highlights the role of ‘crisis’ moments in justifying a series of pivotal re-articulations. Most important has been the attachment of AI to the narrative around digital automation in human healthcare. Greatly enabled by the societal context of the pandemic, all three institutions have moved from being critical of the unequal power relations in the economy of AI to, today, reframing themselves primarily as facilitators tasked with helping to ensure the application of AI technologies. The analysis identifies a shift in which human health and healthcare is framed as in a ‘crisis’ to which AI technology is presented as the remedy. The article argues the need to trace these discursive shifts as a means by which to understand, monitor, and where necessary also hold to account these changes in the governance of AI in society.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI has stimulated substantial discourse on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains such as academia, business, and society at large. Although AI has been utilized in numerous areas for several years, the emergence of generative AI (GAI) applications such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or DALL-E are considered a breakthrough for the acceleration of AI technology due to their ease of use, intuitive interface, and performance. With GAI, it is possible to create a variety of content such as texts, images, audio, code, and even videos. This creates a variety of implications for businesses requiring a deeper examination, including an influence on business model innovation (BMI). Therefore, this study provides a BMI perspective on GAI with two primary contributions: (1) The development of six comprehensive propositions outlining the impact of GAI on businesses, and (2) the discussion of three industry examples, specifically software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. This study employs a qualitative content analysis using a scoping review methodology, drawing from a wide-ranging sample of 513 data points. These include academic publications, company reports, and public information such as press releases, news articles, interviews, and podcasts. The study thus contributes to the growing academic discourse in management research concerning AI's potential impact and offers practical insights into how to utilize this technology to develop new or improve existing business models.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Modern machine learning methods allow for complex and in-depth analytics, but the predictive models generated by these methods are often highly complex and lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are used to improve the interpretability of these complex “black box” models, thereby increasing transparency and enabling informed decision-making. However, the inherent fitness of these explainable methods, particularly the faithfulness of explanations to the decision-making processes of the model, can be hard to evaluate. In this work, we examine and evaluate the explanations provided by four XAI methods, using fully transparent “glass box” models trained on tabular data. Our results suggest that the fidelity of explanations is determined by the types of variables used, as well as the linearity of the relationship between variables and model prediction. We find that each XAI method evaluated has its own strengths and weaknesses, determined by the assumptions inherent in the explanation mechanism. Thus, though such methods are model-agnostic, we find significant differences in explanation quality across different technical setups. Given the numerous factors that determine the quality of explanations, including the specific explanation-generation procedures implemented by XAI methods, we suggest that model-agnostic XAI methods may still require expert guidance for implementation.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The European Union (EU) is in the middle of comprehensively regulating artificial intelligence (AI) through an effort known as the AI Act. Within the vast spectrum of issues under the Act’s aegis, the treatment of technologies classified as general purpose AI systems (GPAIS) merits special consideration. Particularly, existing proposals to define GPAIS do not provide sufficient guidance to distinguish these systems from those designed to perform specific tasks, denominated as fixed-purpose. Thus, our working paper has three objectives: first, to highlight the variance and ambiguity in the interpretation of GPAIS in the literature; second, to examine the dimensions of the generality of purpose available to define GPAIS; lastly, to propose a functional definition of the term that facilitates its governance within the EU. Our intention with this piece is to offer policymakers an alternative perspective on GPAIS that improves the hard and soft law efforts to mitigate these systems’ risks and protect the well-being and future of constituencies in the EU and globally.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

To address this void, we develop a novel measurement instrument to assess RAI maturity in firms. A review of the nascent literature reveals that there is a wide distribution of RAI capabilities.

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Building artificial intelligence (AI) systems that adhere to ethical standards is a complex problem. Even though a multitude of guidelines for the design and development of such trustworthy AI systems exist, these guidelines focus on high-level and abstract requirements for AI systems, and it is often very difficult to assess if a specific system fulfills these requirements. The Z-Inspection® process provides a holistic and dynamic framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of specific AI systems at different stages of the AI lifecycle, including intended use, design, and development. It focuses, in particular, on the discussion and identification of ethical issues and tensions through the analysis of socio-technical scenarios and a requirement-based framework for ethical and trustworthy AI. This article is a methodological reflection on the Z-Inspection® process. We illustrate how high-level guidelines for ethical and trustworthy AI can be applied in practice and provide insights for both AI researchers and AI practitioners. We share the lessons learned from conducting a series of independent assessments to evaluate the trustworthiness of real-world AI systems, as well as key recommendations and practical suggestions on how to ensure a rigorous trustworthiness assessment throughout the lifecycle of an AI system.

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>With numerous conversational AI (CAI) systems being deployed in homes, cars, and public spaces, people are faced with an increasing number of privacy and security decisions. They need to decide which personal information to disclose and how their data can be processed by providers and developers. On the other hand, designers, developers, and integrators of conversational AI systems must consider users’ privacy and security during development and make appropriate choices. However, users as well as other actors in the CAI ecosystem can suffer from cognitive biases and other mental flaws in their decision-making resulting in adverse privacy and security choices. Debiasing strategies can help to mitigate these biases and improve decision-making. In this position paper, we establish a novel framework for categorizing debiasing strategies, show how existing privacy debiasing strategies can be adapted to the context of CAI, and assign them to relevant stakeholders of the CAI ecosystem. We highlight the unique possibilities of CAI to foster debiasing, discuss limitations of the strategies, and identify research challenges.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) have gained significant interest from both, industry and academia. Notably, conventional ML techniques require enormous amounts of power to meet the desired accuracy, which has limited their use mainly to high-capability devices such as network nodes. However, with many advancements in technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, it is desirable to incorporate ML techniques into resource-constrained embedded devices for distributed and ubiquitous intelligence. This has motivated the emergence of the TinyML paradigm which is an embedded ML technique that enables ML applications on multiple cheap, resource- and power-constrained devices. However, during this transition towards appropriate implementation of the TinyML technology, multiple challenges such as processing capacity optimisation, improved reliability, and maintenance of learning models’ accuracy require timely solutions. In this article, various avenues available for TinyML implementation are reviewed. Firstly, a background of TinyML is provided, followed by detailed discussions on various tools supporting TinyML. Then, state-of-art applications of TinyML using advanced technologies are detailed. Lastly, detailed prospects are presented which include various research challenges and identification of future directions.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Autonomous systems are machines that can alter their behavior without direct human oversight or control. How ought we to program them to behave? A plausible starting point is given by the Reduction to Acts Thesis, according to which we ought to program autonomous systems to do whatever a human agent ought to do in the same circumstances. Although the Reduction to Acts Thesis is initially appealing, we argue that it is false: it is sometimes permissible to program a machine to do something that it would be wrong for a human to do. We advance two main arguments for this claim. First, the way an autonomous system will behave can be known in advance. This knowledge can indirectly affect the behavior of other agents, while the same may not be true at the time the system actually executes its programming. Second, a lack of knowledge of the identities of the victims and beneficiaries can provide a justification during the programming phase that would be unavailable to an agent at the time the autonomous system executes its programming.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

      "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Algorithmic decision-making systems have the potential to amplify existing discriminatory patterns and negatively affect perceptions of justice in society. There is a need for a revision of mechanisms to address discrimination in light of the unique challenges presented by these systems, which are not easily auditable or explainable. Research efforts to bring fairness to ADM solutions should be viewed as a matter of justice and trust among actors should be ensured through technology design. Ideas that move us to explore the notions of justice within the field of political thinking, aiming to identify the elements that frame the social context of the discriminatory decisions produced by algorithmic decision-making solutions. Our explorations suggest that the efforts to bring fairness to ADMs should be seen as a matter of justice and that trust in these systems can be ensured through careful technology design.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

Substantial rearchitecting will be necessary to allow proper functioning of a highly-diversified space-air-ground-sea physical infrastructure, along with operation at frequency ranges spanning from sub-GHz, to millimeter-waves (mm-Waves), again to sub-THz (100–300 GHz) and above. In this work, we focus on the radio frequency (RF) portion of the infrastructure, and in particular on micro-relays for channel commuting and reconfiguration of passive elements. To this end, we report on high-performance and highly-miniaturized micro-switches based on microelectromechanical-systems (MEMS) technology, known as RF-MEMS. A few different design concepts of RF-MEMS-based series ohmic switches are reported, discussed and compared, with the support of finite element method (FEM) modeling and RF experimental characterization up to 110 GHz.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The lightning-fast development of artificial intelligence and neural networks in general has had a tremendous impact on many different fields, and biological engineering is only one of those fields. These innovations have the potential to completely revolutionize the field of medicine by enhancing diagnostics, treatment planning, and tailored medication. This might be accomplished. However, there are ethical and legal concerns about the manner in which they should be incorporated into biomedicine. This study's objective is to investigate the existing legal frameworks that regulate the uses of artificial intelligence and neural networks in biomedical engineering and to evaluate how effectively such frameworks address the challenges posed by technological inclusion. On a global, regional, and national basis, we evaluated the rules and regulations that regulate the use of artificial intelligence and neural networks in biomedical engineering. These laws and regulations control the field. According to the findings of our research, even if the current legal frameworks have been improved in some respects, substantial problems are still present. These problems are particularly prevalent in the areas of data privacy, algorithmic responsibility, and ethical dilemmas. Also, the article discusses the need of doing ongoing evaluations and making adjustments in order to keep up with the fast advancement of artificial intelligence and neural networks in the area of biomedical engineering.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Flexible manufacturing systems in high-mix low-volume segments offer many challenges in terms of planning and scheduling. The complexity of these systems often requires a systemic approach for which humans are the perfect actors. However, computer systems can support scheduling tasks more effectively due to their capacity to synthesize large amounts of data. This paper describes a system developed for the flexible manufacturing of wooden doors with a wide range of product configurations. This paper proposes a rule-based scheduling method for high-mix production. The method was applied and validated at a wooden door producer. Based on the company's production schedule for a given week, a scheduling program was developed that suggested minor rearrangements for production leveling. As the rule-based approach makes the decisions verifiable, the program was validated at the producer, through a case study of production leveling under volume constraints. The results include the complete elimination of changeovers and the stabilization of throughput, which improved the precision of the delivery time. The producer is integrating the program into their production planning and control system. Thus, the results suggest that the proposed method can be useful for scheduling high-mix low-volume production, and merits further validation in similar environments.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

Likewise, the fluctuation within the individual companies has increased drastically within the last few years. As a result, experience gained over many years is being lost. On the other hand, there is a strong trend towards an ever-increasing number of very complex manufacturing processes with a large number of process influencing variables, where the human monitoring capabilities are limited. In this work we study the complex process of hot stamping of metal blanks for car body parts with a demonstrator plant. The demonstrator plant consists of five main components, comprising a magazine for material feed, an industrial robot for transferring the raw material and the finished part, an annealing furnace, and a hydraulic press with the temperature controlled hot forming tool inside. All machines have open communication interfaces with which all sensor data can be accessed. The demonstrator plant is additionally outfitted with different sensors measuring crucial process parameters. We use temperature sensors in the punch and die and make use of capturing the structure-borne sound and mechanical vibrations during the process to closely monitor the process. This sensor data is analyzed and methods of machine learning are used to detect anomalies in the process data. The goal of this work is to develop a methodology for the systematic detection of anomalies in the hot forming process using machine learning methods within a demonstrator plant that are suitable for real time anomaly detection for a high level control system. We use unsupervised machine learning techniques and neural networks to detect anomalies with great accuracy on our test data.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

They are used in many industries to interact with customers, respond to frequently asked inquiries, and carry out specific duties for which they were designed. More AI enabled chatbots are being used in the tourism industry to provide better customer service to the travellers. In the literature review, researches relating to adoption of AI chatbots in tourism are scarce. The paper extends the UTAUT2 model and examines the aspects that impact consumer adoption of AI chatbots in the travel and tourism segment. We used a quantitative research approach and the data was collected through online surveys. A total of 466 responses were collected from frequent travellers. Partial least square approach was utilized to do the data analysis. The emanating outcome of this research study divulge the aspects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, habit, personal innovativeness, and awareness of chatbot service optimistically influenced the behavioural intention to make use of AI chatbots for tourism services. Awareness of service also indirectly influenced intention to use through performance and effort expectancies.

The integration of data between BIM models and IoT devices enables the creation of Digital Twins (DTs) of built heritage assets, capable of connecting data coming continuously from sensors with digital models of those assets. This enables the management of large masses of data produced at various stages of the building lifecycle, making it possible to experiment with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics for predictive analysis of building system behavior and performance. This paper presents the results of a research, which aimed to develop a methodological and operational workflow for the creation of Digital Twin of buildings. The interoperability offered by the IFC schema allowed the use of an external platform for linking different semantic fields. Thus, on the one hand, a federated BIM model was created, and on the other hand, real-time acquired data from a system of sensors in-stalled at different locations in the building were recorded and stored in a central server.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The recent COVID-19 pandemic has served as a timely reminder that the existing drug discovery is a laborious, expensive, and slow process. Never has there been such global demand for a therapeutic treatment to be identified as a matter of such urgency. Unfortunately, this is a scenario likely to repeat itself in future, so it is of interest to explore ways in which to accelerate drug discovery at pandemic speed. Computational methods naturally lend themselves to this because they can be performed rapidly if sufficient computational resources are available. Recently, high-performance computing (HPC) technologies have led to remarkable achievements in computational drug discovery and yielded a series of new platforms, algorithms, and workflows. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches is also a promising and relatively new avenue to revolutionize the drug design process and therefore reduce costs. In this review, I describe how molecular dynamics simulations (MD) were successfully integrated with ML and adapted to HPC to form a powerful tool to study inhibitors for four of the COVID-19 target proteins. The emphasis of this review is on the strategy that was used with an explanation of each of the steps in the accelerated drug discovery workflow.

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Cyber-physical systems and Industry-4.0 have made smart manufacturing possible. The multi-national companies were able to quickly adapt and cope with changing times, but the micro small-scale enterprises (m-SMEs) were at crossroads to adopt new technology due to extensive costs involved. This gap of no existing solutions for micro-SMEs is the result of literature survey for this work. Then the COVID-19 pandemic made it extremely difficult for micro-SMEs to survive. This paper implements a smart manufacturing solution for production facility at one such micro-SME. Pre-pandemic, their facility had enough production to satisfy the demand, but pandemic overwhelmed their production with rapid rise in demand. The main goal for this study is to make the micro-SME cope this unprecedented rise in demand. The production facility was upgraded, and smart features were incorporated based on cyber-physical production systems framework to predict demand and transform a manual manufacturing into smart manufacturing. With more than one product being produced, optimum production was achieved avoiding over/underproduction for different products given the limited storage capacity available with the micro-SMEs.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

Artificial intelligence technology has a deep impact on different disciplines and can improve the efficiency of architectural skin design and inspire architects. In order to find new expressions of the building skin, it is necessary to focus on the dialogue between the architectural skin and the environment, and to innovate by breaking away from the patterned and formalized design. This work combines the development of artificial intelligence to initially explore the role of neural style transfer for architectural skin design, where the fusion of different styles of architectural images is programmed to generate another style, thus allowing architects to make clearer decisions and judgments. After performing neural style migration on five different types of buildings, the results obtained can present the new style form more completely, which provides new ideas and inspiration for the application of artificial intelligence in architectural design.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Brazil, despite its recent advances in the regulatory sphere for Privacy and Data Protection, still remains unregulated regarding the use of artificial intelligence. In 2020, two years after the enactment of the General Law on Data Protection (LGPD), a Bill emerged that was the first Brazilian attempt not only to regulate, but also to define, classify, and identify AI-powered tools. However, among confusing meanings and vague typifications, the proposal failed to become the prototype that would generate a regulatory framework that encompasses both preventive compliance methods and possible remedial solutions for eventual disputes. Thus, the need emerges to seek pre-existing solutions in the Brazilian legislation that, although still undefined and precariously implemented, may be consolidated in the future as indispensable tools for the identification of eventual failures. This is where the mandatory implementation of the impact assessment comes in as a potential solution for the detailed analysis of AI-powered systems. Software architectures that are programmed to make automated decisions by means of machine learning techniques, for example, present certain risks, but the level of risk is unknown, precisely because of the lack of transparency about how their internal architectures work. Thus, a continuous and properly documented risk assessment will provide essential analysis both to substantiate a preventive system that survives the wear and tear of time in relation to inexorable technological advancement, and to serve as a broad and precise regulation, which will work as a legal instrument for any legal dispute that may arise in the years to come.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The advancements in artificial intelligence are triggering discussions on transforming many processes in the industry, society or economy, including the healthcare sector. The new capabilities offered by emerging technologies applied in healthcare help deliver more accurate and efficient diagnoses and treatment options. Artificial intelligence models can be used for various purposes in healthcare, from functions such as personal assistant, up to analyzing data and providing recommendations for tasks such as medical imaging analysis, drug development, disease identification, and emergency support. Furthermore, artificial intelligence models can support research actions, to speed up the development of certain cures or medicines. They can also assist in detecting high-risk conditions in patients, discovering and researching new drugs and medicines, and developing new treatment plans. However, these digital technologies come with cybersecurity risks, both due to the underlying technical systems, such as computers used, up to the risks or issues in the models themselves, which can lead to questions on the accuracy of the recommendations and solutions provided by the models, or data breaches and cyber-attacks. Such incidents can lead to serious consequences, including compromised data privacy and safety. This paper presents some potential use cases of the AI model in the healthcare industry. In addition, several cyber security recommendations are offered to ensure that the adoption and use of such emerging tools minimize potential cyber risks.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>It is a challenging task to teach machines to paint like human artists in a stroke-by-stroke fashion. Despite advances in stroke-based image rendering and deep learning-based image rendering, existing painting methods have limitations: they (i) lack flexibility to choose different art-style strokes, (ii) lose content details of images, and (iii) generate few artistic styles for paintings. In this paper, we propose a stroke-style generative adversarial network, called Stroke-GAN, to solve the first two limitations. Stroke-GAN learns styles of strokes from different stroke-style datasets, so can produce diverse stroke styles. We design three players in Stroke-GAN to generate pure-color strokes close to human artists’ strokes, thereby improving the quality of painted details. To overcome the third limitation, we have devised a neural network named Stroke-GAN Painter, based on Stroke-GAN; it can generate different artistic styles of paintings. Experiments demonstrate that our artful painter can generate various styles of paintings while well-preserving content details (such as details of human faces and building textures) and retaining high fidelity to the input images.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The challenges associated with diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease (CVD)/Stroke in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) arise from the delayed onset of symptoms. Existing clinical risk scores are inadequate in predicting cardiac events, and conventional risk factors alone do not accurately classify many individuals at risk. Several CVD biomarkers consider the multiple pathways involved in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the primary cause of CVD/Stroke in RA. To enhance the accuracy of CVD/Stroke risk assessment in the RA framework, a proposed approach involves combining genomic-based biomarkers (GBBM) derived from plasma and/or serum samples with innovative non-invasive radiomic-based biomarkers (RBBM), such as measurements of synovial fluid, plaque area, and plaque burden. This review presents two hypotheses: (i) RBBM and GBBM biomarkers exhibit a significant correlation and can precisely detect the severity of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based preventive, precision, and personalized (aiP<superscript>3</superscript>) CVD/Stroke risk AtheroEdge™ model (AtheroPoint™, CA, USA) that utilizes deep learning (DL) to accurately classify the risk of CVD/stroke in RA framework. The authors conducted a comprehensive search using the PRISMA technique, identifying 153 studies that assessed the features/biomarkers of RBBM and GBBM for CVD/Stroke. The study demonstrates how DL models can be integrated into the AtheroEdge™–aiP<superscript>3</superscript> framework to determine the risk of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. The findings of this review suggest that the combination of RBBM with GBBM introduces a new dimension to the assessment of CVD/Stroke risk in the RA framework. Synovial fluid levels that are higher than normal lead to an increase in the plaque burden. Additionally, the review provides recommendations for novel, unbiased, and pruned DL algorithms that can predict CVD/Stroke risk within a RA framework that is preventive, precise, and personalized.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Medical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have consistently shown remarkable performance in providing medical professionals and patients with support for complex tasks. Nevertheless, the use of these applications in sensitive clinical domains where high-stakes decisions are involved could be much more extensive if patients, medical professionals, and regulators were provided with mechanisms for trusting the results provided by AI systems. A key issue for achieving this is endowing AI systems with key dimensions of Trustworthy AI (TAI), such as fairness, transparency, robustness, or accountability, which are not usually considered within this context in a generalized and systematic manner. This paper reviews the recent advances in the TAI domain, including TAI standards and guidelines. We propose several requirements to be addressed in the design, development, and deployment of TAI systems and present a novel machine learning pipeline that contains TAI requirements as embedded components. Moreover, as an example of how current AI systems in medicine consider the TAI perspective, the study extensively reviews the recent literature (2017–2021) on AI systems in a prevalent and high social-impact disease: diagnosis and progression detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The most relevant AI systems in the AD domain are compared and discussed (such as machine learning, deep learning, ensembles, time series, and multimodal multitask) from the perspective of how they address TAI in their design. Several open challenges are highlighted, which could be claimed as one of the main reasons to justify the rare application of AI systems in real clinical environments. The study provides a roadmap to measure the TAI status of an AI systems and highlights its limitations. In addition, it provides the main guidelines to overcome these limitations and build medically trusted AI-based applications in the medical domain.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>This article considers current advances in tattooing that are challenging community-held views of authorship and ownership, and the need to address this tension. The key challenge is from AI-generated artworks being used as tattoo designs, but the authorial role of the tattooist is also challenged by body art projects such as tattoo collection. Legal clarity for tattooing is lacking, and in addressing this, this article advocates for an open, community-based form of shared copyright ownership and authorship for projects as tattoo collecting, drawing on Dusollier’s and Mendis’ work. This article contributes to both copyright and cultural heritage legal scholarship, and to tattooing scholarship and the tattooing community. AI-generated art being tattooed on people has not been explored in the literature to date, and this article fills this gap. Furthermore, this article contributes a pilot study of the tattoo community’s views on AI-generated tattoos, which is currently lacking from the scholarly debate on AI-generated art. This article argues that the debate within the tattoo community about AI-generated art being used in tattoos needs to be addressed within the community through agreed extra-legal norms, which may well depart from how copyright law decides to approach AI-generated art globally. This article also asserts that AI should <emphasis type=\"Italic\">not</emphasis> be regarded as the “author” of tattoo works in the traditional copyright sense, as only a human tattooist can draw from a number of cultural, textual, audiovisual and visual, cultural folklore, history and mythical references in creating their tattoo designs, as well as drawing on the client’s personal stories. This article explores the following: (i) an understanding of tattooing as an artform; (ii) tattoos in UK copyright law; (iii) an exploration of the authorial role of the tattooist within tattooing; (iv) the authorial role of the tattooist within tattoo collecting; (v) AI-generated tattoos—perspectives from the tattoo community, through a pilot study of YouTube videos and viewer comments about this; and (vi) a consideration of whether copyright legal reform is the solution for the tattooing community.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Stock market’s volatile and complex nature makes it difficult to predict the market situation. Deep Learning is capable of simulating and analyzing complex patterns in unstructured data. Deep learning models have applications in image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and many more. Its application in stock market prediction is gaining attention because of its capacity to handle large datasets and data mapping with accurate prediction. However, most methods ignore the impact of mass media on the company’s stock and investors’ behaviours. This work proposes a hybrid deep learning model combining Word2Vec and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. The main objective is to design an intelligent tool to forecast the directional movement of stock market prices based on financial time series and news headlines as inputs. The binary predicted output obtained using the proposed model would aid investors in making better decisions. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed in terms of accuracy of the prediction of directional movement of stock prices of five companies from different sectors of operation.\n",

We retrospectively evaluated 73 thoraco-abdominal CTAs (48 AAA and 25 control CTA) by means of a DL-based segmentation pipeline built on a 2.5D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to segment lumen and thrombus of the aorta. The maximum aortic diameter of the abdominal tract was compared using a threshold value (30 mm). Blinded manual measurements from a radiologist were done in order to create a true comparison. The screening pipeline was tested on 48 patients with aneurysm and 25 without aneurysm. The average diameter manually measured was 51.1 ± 14.4 mm for patients with aneurysms and 21.7 ± 3.6 mm for patients without aneurysms. The pipeline correctly classified 47 AAA out of 48 and 24 control patients out of 25 with 97% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 96% specificity. The automated pipeline of aneurysm measurements in the abdominal tract reported a median error with regard to the maximum abdominal diameter measurement of 1.3 mm. Our approach allowed for the maximum diameter of 51.2 ± 14.3 mm in patients with aneurysm and 22.0 ± 4.0 mm in patients without an aneurysm. The DL-based screening for AAA is a feasible and accurate method, calling for further validation using a larger pool of diagnostic images towards its clinical use.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Google’s Bard has emerged as a formidable competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT in the field of conversational AI. Notably, Bard has recently been updated to handle visual inputs alongside text prompts during conversations. Given Bard’s impressive track record in handling textual inputs, we explore its capabilities in understanding and interpreting visual data (images) conditioned by text questions. This exploration holds the potential to unveil new insights and challenges for Bard and other forthcoming multi-modal Generative models, especially in addressing complex computer vision problems that demand accurate visual and language understanding. Specifically, in this study, we focus on 15 diverse task scenarios encompassing regular, camouflaged, medical, under-water and remote sensing data to comprehensively evaluate Bard’s performance. Our primary finding indicates that Bard still struggles in these vision scenarios, highlighting the significant gap in vision-based understanding that needs to be bridged in future developments. We expect that this empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, leading to enhanced capabilities in comprehending and interpreting fine-grained visual data.

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection literature clearly defines semantic shift as a sign of OOD but does not have a consensus over covariate shift. Samples experiencing covariate shift but not semantic shift from the in-distribution (ID) are either excluded from the test set or treated as OOD, which contradicts the primary goal in machine learning—being able to generalize beyond the training distribution. In this paper, we take into account both shift types and introduce full-spectrum OOD (F-OOD) detection, a more realistic problem setting that considers both detecting semantic shift and being tolerant to covariate shift; and design three benchmarks. These new benchmarks have a more fine-grained categorization of distributions (<emphasis type=\"Italic\">i.e</emphasis>let@tokeneonedot, training ID, covariate-shifted ID, near-OOD, and far-OOD) for the purpose of more comprehensively evaluating the pros and cons of algorithms. To address the F-OOD detection problem, we propose SEM, a simple feature-based semantics score function. SEM is mainly composed of two probability measures: one is based on high-level features containing both semantic and non-semantic information, while the other is based on low-level feature statistics only capturing non-semantic image styles. With a simple combination, the non-semantic part is canceled out, which leaves only semantic information in SEM that can better handle F-OOD detection. Extensive experiments on the three new benchmarks show that SEM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Our code and benchmarks are released in <externalref>\n",

Generative AI models have garnered significant attention for their potential in educational settings, but image-generative AI models need to be more utilized. This study explores the potential of integrating generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, into art-focused STEAM classes. To this end, we combined STEAM education with image-generative AI. We designed and implemented a learning activity in which students used image-generative AI to generate creative images and wrote imaginative diaries inspired by AI-generated pictures. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected and analyzed data from surveys, interviews, and prompt datasets to gain insights into students' perceptions, motivations, and behaviors concerning the integration of generative AI in art education. Our study found that incorporating generative AI into art-focused STEAM classes may reduce the gap between male and female students' interest in art practices. We also found that the number of subjects in students' prompt datasets is linked to their divergent and convergent thinking. Finally, we discovered a meaningful correlation between the number of unique words in students' diaries and the image scores that researchers assessed. Our findings shed light on the relationship between students' divergent and convergent behaviors, offering valuable insights into their creative thinking processes.

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Much more than their machinic reality, current iterations of AI rely on imagined divisions of human and non-human properties and skills that have genealogical ties to colonization. For this reason, research efforts have recently been made to historicize these imaginaries, connecting them to colonial ideals that delegate black and brown colonized people into the realm of the non-human. Atanasoski and Vora (Surrogate humanity. Race, robots and the politics of technological futures, Duke, Durham and London, 2019) have called this a “surrogate humanity”, where narratives of autonomous technologies function to disappear precisely the formerly colonized peoples that are enveloped in its production process. At the same time, the gendered and racialized roots of this maternal figure represents an opportunity to uncover and critique the invisibilization of embodied resources necessary to produce AI, precarious bodies labouring to produce algorithmic infrastructures in a manner that can be considered in a genealogy of carework and reproduction. These genealogies complicate the detachment suggested by the surrogate figure and go beyond it to proclaim a more generative function of the relationship between the black maternal figure and AI. The article analyses Tabita Rezaire’s multi-media artwork <emphasis type=\"Italic\">Sugar Walls Teardom</emphasis> to think through decolonial and queer renderings of the black female bodies upon which technological imaginaries rest, to extend beyond AI surrogacy and towards notions of kinship, care and world-making by producing an AI aesthetics that is relational, embodied, and celebratory of other ways of liveness.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>This paper proposes a Reconfigurable In-Memory Advance Computing architecture using a novel 10 SRAM cell. In addition to basic logic operations, the proposed R-InMAC can also implement complex Boolean computing operations such as binary addition/subtraction, binary-to-gray, gray-to-binary conversion, 2’s complement, less/greater than, and increment/decrement. Furthermore, content addressable memory (CAM) operation to search a binary string in a memory array is also proposed efficiently. It can search true and complementary data strings in a single cycle. The proposed R-InMAC architecture’s reconfigurability allows it to be configured according to the needed operation and bit precision, making it ideal and energy-efficient. In addition, compared to the standard SRAM cells, the proposed 10T cell is suited for implementing the XNOR-based binary convolution operation required in Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) with improved latency of 58.89%. The optimized full adder of the proposed R-InMAC shows decrement in the area by 40%, static power by 28%, dynamic power by 55.2%, and latency by 25.3% as compared to conventional designs, making this work a promising candidate for modern edge AI compute in-memory systems.\n",

This research performs a high-level matching between AI solutions and challenges within the port area by developing a novel academic approach. This way, the matching is carried out more structured than when one (manager, developer, challenge owner, etc.) fulfils it based on their opinion without following any structured approach. Therefore, the study defines first a comprehensive typology of port stakeholders' challenges, which can be solved via AI solutions. This typology presents challenges, including their main issues, widespread impact, and potential solutions. A state-of-the-art review of AI solutions that can address these challenges is carried out in parallel. Secondly, this review clearly distinguishes between AI solutions based on their technology and functionality. Thirdly, this research selects an appropriate AI solution for addressing each identified challenge in the port operation by upgrading the Gale–Shapley algorithm. Finally, it shows that the most critical presented AI solutions in this study use various machine learning (ML) techniques. Besides, concerning the AI solution's reusability feature and the result of high-level matching, this research shows that the implementation phase effort can be drastically reduced by using the recently developed matching algorithm.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Singularitarianism is a view that is grounded in certain claims about the technological singularity. In this paper, I identify a trilemma that confronts singularitarianism. This trilemma may be characterized in terms of the following horns: the concept of a technological singularity having a literal sense, the concept of a technological singularity having a metaphorical sense, and the concept of a technological singularity having neither a literal nor a metaphorical sense (i.e., its being nonsensical). I will outline the unpalatable consequences that are associated with each of these three horns of the trilemma. I will also anticipate a few argumentative moves on behalf of singularitarianism and suggest why these moves may be insufficient. I will conclude by arguing that we have good philosophical grounds to defend an eliminativism about the concept of the technological singularity.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>One of the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 is to keep the unemployment rate at the lowest level to empower the economy. Prior research has shown that an increase in unemployment has a negative effect on a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This paper aims to utilise cutting-edge technology such as Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist the Saudi labour market by matching job seekers with vacant positions. Currently, human experts carry out this process; however, this is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Moreover, in the Saudi labour market, this process does not use a cohesive data centre to monitor, integrate or analyse labour-market data, resulting in several inefficiencies, such as bias and latency. These inefficiencies arise from a lack of technologies and, more importantly, from having an open labour-market without a national data centre. This paper proposes a new AI Recruiting Model (AIRM) architecture that exploits DLs, ML and AI to rapidly and efficiently match job seekers to vacant positions in the Saudi labour market. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is employed to test the proposed AIRM architecture using a labour market dataset simulation corpus for training purposes; the architecture is further evaluated against three research collaborators who are all professionals in Human Resources (HR). As this research is data-driven in nature, it requires collaboration from domain experts. The first layer of the AIRM architecture uses balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH) as a clustering algorithm for the initial screening layer. The mapping layer uses sentence transformers with a robustly optimised BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) as the base model, and ranking is carried out using the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). Finally, the preferences layer takes the user’s preferences as a list and sorts the results using the pre-trained cross-encoders model, considering the weight of the more important words. This new AIRM has yielded favourable outcomes: This research considered accepting an AIRM selection ratified by at least one HR expert to account for the subjective character of the selection process when exclusively handled by human HR experts. The research evaluated the AIRM using two metrics: accuracy and time. The AIRM had an overall matching accuracy of 84%, with at least one expert agreeing with the system’s output. Furthermore, it completed the task in 2.4 min, whereas human experts took more than 6 days on average. Overall, the AIRM outperforms humans in task execution, making it useful in pre-selecting a group of applicants and positions. The AIRM is not limited to government services. It can also help any commercial business that uses Big Data.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Wildfires are among the most threatening hazards to life, property, well-being, and the environment. Studying public opinions about wildfires can help monitor the perception of the impacted communities. Nevertheless, wildfire research is relatively limited compared to other climate-related hazards. This article presents our data mining work on public opinions about wildfires in Australia from 2014 to 2021. Three key aspects are analyzed: the topic of concern, sentiment polarization, and perceived emotions. We propose a data filtering approach to acquire golden samples to train a supervised model for emotion quantification to achieve the last target. The results show that the new model produces a more accurate emotion estimation than the existing lexicon approach. Through data analysis, we find that people have seen wildfires as one of the impacts of climate change; trends of tweets can reflect the damage of wildfires in real life.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

A separate sub-branch of AI solicitudes on reliability is known as Explainable AI (XAI). XAI analyses the cause and impact of the decision made by AI systems. The neural network plays a significant part in AI's ability to upgrade with more recent data. However, the learning capability left the model obscure for most of its decisions. Breaking the black-box nature of the neural network model and giving understanding and insight into the functionality of the model will mitigate the uncertainty.

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Personality describes an individual’s internal attributes, encompassing distinctive thoughts, emotions, and behaviour. Various studies have been undertaken to quantify these personality traits using externally visible cues and measures. Despite the possibility of a disparity between the apparent and real personality traits, researchers have identified various deep learning techniques to measure the apparent personality as part of the ChaLearn Looking at People, ECCV challenge. We provide an overview of the different deep learning models used for apparent personality detection. The primary objective of previous studies was to develop highly accurate prediction models, and subsequently, the focus shifted towards interpreting the output of these techniques. Although explainable AI (XAI) techniques have shown that facial features are essential in predicting personality, the consistency of these results is still a critical factor to consider. Moreover, the majority of studies utilized the ECCV challenge CVPR’17 dataset to predict apparent personality; therefore, there is a requirement to validate these findings through additional datasets. In conclusion, ample scope exists for further research in the domain of personality detection that can yield highly accurate and more interpretable models.\n",

However, when humans evaluate creativity, their judgment is clouded by biases triggered by the characteristics of the creator. Drawing from folk psychology and algorithm aversion research, we examine whether the identity of the producer of a given artifact as artificial intelligence (AI) or human is a source of bias affecting people’s creativity evaluation of such artifact and what drives this effect. With four experimental studies (<emphasis type=\"Italic\">N</emphasis> = 2039), of which two were pre-registered, using different experimental designs and evaluation targets, we found that people sometimes—but not always—ascribe lower creativity to a product when they are told that the producer is an AI rather than a human. In addition, we found that people consistently perceive generative AI to exert less effort than humans in the creation of a given artifact, which drives the lower creativity ratings ascribed to generative AI producers. We discuss the implication of these findings for organizational creativity and innovation in the context of human-AI interaction.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Dimension reductions (DR) help people make sense of image collections by organizing images in the 2D space based on similarities. However, they provide little support for explaining why images were placed together or apart in the 2D space. Additionally, they do not provide support for modifying and updating the 2D representation to explore new relationships and organizations of images. To address these problems, we present an interactive DR method for images that uses visual features extracted by a deep neural network to project the images into 2D space and provides visual explanations of image features that contributed to the 2D location. In addition, it allows people to directly manipulate the 2D projection space to define alternative relationships and explore subsequent projections of the images. With an iterative cycle of semantic interaction and explainable-AI feedback, people can explore complex visual relationships in image data. Our approach to human–AI interaction integrates visual knowledge from both human-mental models and pre-trained deep neural models to explore image data. We demonstrate our method through examples with collaborators in agricultural science and other applications.

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Currently, there is a significant amount of research being conducted in the field of artificial intelligence to improve the explainability and interpretability of deep learning models. It is found that if end-users understand the reason for the production of some output, it is easier to trust the system. Recommender systems are one example of systems that great efforts have been conducted to make their output more explainable. One method for producing a more explainable output is using counterfactual reasoning, which involves altering minimal features to generate a counterfactual item that results in changing the output of the system. This process allows the identification of input features that have a significant impact on the desired output, leading to effective explanations. In this paper, we present a method for generating counterfactual explanations for both tabular and textual features. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method on three real-world datasets and demonstrated a +5% improvement on finding effective features (based on model-based measures) compared to the baseline method.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Social media has revolutionized the way information is distributed throughout society, as folks continue to rely entirely on these apps for information on current events, health protocols, and socio-political discussions. However, these containers of knowledge do not appear in the same shape for every user; Algorithms, informed by capitalist agendas, determine what information sifts through its networks and to whom. Data scientists, researchers, and activists have dissected the hidden mechanics fueling these popular platforms, inciting critical conversations around the harmful biases embedded in algorithms. These studies often skim the surface of how these algorithms digitally marginalize people of color, if acknowledging it at all. Even fewer have attempted to examine the role these algorithms play in the social activism and digital community organizing happening amongst communities of color via social media. Referring to indigenous scholar Marisa Elena Duarte’s book Network Sovereignty as a framework of thought, this paper roots itself in the notion that technology is an extension of the agenda utilizing it. Through dissecting the algorithmic structures of popular social platforms among communities of color, this paper examines how social media distributes information within its networks and how its encoded biases silence Black, brown, and indigenous voices. This paper also provides insight into how BIPOC content-creators, when informed on how the algorithms work, can use these platforms to their advantage and effectively facilitate socio-political discourse online; Changing the narrative of social networks from being yet another landscape of white supremacy to instead a communal canvas for radical change.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The term ‘artificial intelligence’ has arguably come to function in political discourse as, what Laclau called, an ‘empty signifier’. This article traces the shifting political discourse on AI within three key institutions of global governance–OHCHR, WHO, and UNESCO–and, in so doing, highlights the role of ‘crisis’ moments in justifying a series of pivotal re-articulations. Most important has been the attachment of AI to the narrative around digital automation in human healthcare. Greatly enabled by the societal context of the pandemic, all three institutions have moved from being critical of the unequal power relations in the economy of AI to, today, reframing themselves primarily as facilitators tasked with helping to ensure the application of AI technologies. The analysis identifies a shift in which human health and healthcare is framed as in a ‘crisis’ to which AI technology is presented as the remedy. The article argues the need to trace these discursive shifts as a means by which to understand, monitor, and where necessary also hold to account these changes in the governance of AI in society.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI has stimulated substantial discourse on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains such as academia, business, and society at large. Although AI has been utilized in numerous areas for several years, the emergence of generative AI (GAI) applications such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or DALL-E are considered a breakthrough for the acceleration of AI technology due to their ease of use, intuitive interface, and performance. With GAI, it is possible to create a variety of content such as texts, images, audio, code, and even videos. This creates a variety of implications for businesses requiring a deeper examination, including an influence on business model innovation (BMI). Therefore, this study provides a BMI perspective on GAI with two primary contributions: (1) The development of six comprehensive propositions outlining the impact of GAI on businesses, and (2) the discussion of three industry examples, specifically software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. This study employs a qualitative content analysis using a scoping review methodology, drawing from a wide-ranging sample of 513 data points. These include academic publications, company reports, and public information such as press releases, news articles, interviews, and podcasts. The study thus contributes to the growing academic discourse in management research concerning AI's potential impact and offers practical insights into how to utilize this technology to develop new or improve existing business models.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Modern machine learning methods allow for complex and in-depth analytics, but the predictive models generated by these methods are often highly complex and lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are used to improve the interpretability of these complex “black box” models, thereby increasing transparency and enabling informed decision-making. However, the inherent fitness of these explainable methods, particularly the faithfulness of explanations to the decision-making processes of the model, can be hard to evaluate. In this work, we examine and evaluate the explanations provided by four XAI methods, using fully transparent “glass box” models trained on tabular data. Our results suggest that the fidelity of explanations is determined by the types of variables used, as well as the linearity of the relationship between variables and model prediction. We find that each XAI method evaluated has its own strengths and weaknesses, determined by the assumptions inherent in the explanation mechanism. Thus, though such methods are model-agnostic, we find significant differences in explanation quality across different technical setups. Given the numerous factors that determine the quality of explanations, including the specific explanation-generation procedures implemented by XAI methods, we suggest that model-agnostic XAI methods may still require expert guidance for implementation.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

Within the vast spectrum of issues under the Act’s aegis, the treatment of technologies classified as general purpose AI systems (GPAIS) merits special consideration. Particularly, existing proposals to define GPAIS do not provide sufficient guidance to distinguish these systems from those designed to perform specific tasks, denominated as fixed-purpose. Thus, our working paper has three objectives: first, to highlight the variance and ambiguity in the interpretation of GPAIS in the literature; second, to examine the dimensions of the generality of purpose available to define GPAIS; lastly, to propose a functional definition of the term that facilitates its governance within the EU. Our intention with this piece is to offer policymakers an alternative perspective on GPAIS that improves the hard and soft law efforts to mitigate these systems’ risks and protect the well-being and future of constituencies in the EU and globally.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

To address this void, we develop a novel measurement instrument to assess RAI maturity in firms. A review of the nascent literature reveals that there is a wide distribution of RAI capabilities.

Even though a multitude of guidelines for the design and development of such trustworthy AI systems exist, these guidelines focus on high-level and abstract requirements for AI systems, and it is often very difficult to assess if a specific system fulfills these requirements. The Z-Inspection® process provides a holistic and dynamic framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of specific AI systems at different stages of the AI lifecycle, including intended use, design, and development. It focuses, in particular, on the discussion and identification of ethical issues and tensions through the analysis of socio-technical scenarios and a requirement-based framework for ethical and trustworthy AI. This article is a methodological reflection on the Z-Inspection® process. We illustrate how high-level guidelines for ethical and trustworthy AI can be applied in practice and provide insights for both AI researchers and AI practitioners. We share the lessons learned from conducting a series of independent assessments to evaluate the trustworthiness of real-world AI systems, as well as key recommendations and practical suggestions on how to ensure a rigorous trustworthiness assessment throughout the lifecycle of an AI system. The results presented in this article are based on our assessments of AI systems in the healthcare sector and environmental monitoring, where we used the framework for trustworthy AI proposed in the <emphasis type=\"Italic\">Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI</emphasis> by the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI. However, the assessment process and the lessons learned can be adapted to other domains and include additional frameworks.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>With numerous conversational AI (CAI) systems being deployed in homes, cars, and public spaces, people are faced with an increasing number of privacy and security decisions. They need to decide which personal information to disclose and how their data can be processed by providers and developers. On the other hand, designers, developers, and integrators of conversational AI systems must consider users’ privacy and security during development and make appropriate choices. However, users as well as other actors in the CAI ecosystem can suffer from cognitive biases and other mental flaws in their decision-making resulting in adverse privacy and security choices. Debiasing strategies can help to mitigate these biases and improve decision-making. In this position paper, we establish a novel framework for categorizing debiasing strategies, show how existing privacy debiasing strategies can be adapted to the context of CAI, and assign them to relevant stakeholders of the CAI ecosystem. We highlight the unique possibilities of CAI to foster debiasing, discuss limitations of the strategies, and identify research challenges.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) have gained significant interest from both, industry and academia. Notably, conventional ML techniques require enormous amounts of power to meet the desired accuracy, which has limited their use mainly to high-capability devices such as network nodes. However, with many advancements in technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, it is desirable to incorporate ML techniques into resource-constrained embedded devices for distributed and ubiquitous intelligence. This has motivated the emergence of the TinyML paradigm which is an embedded ML technique that enables ML applications on multiple cheap, resource- and power-constrained devices. However, during this transition towards appropriate implementation of the TinyML technology, multiple challenges such as processing capacity optimisation, improved reliability, and maintenance of learning models’ accuracy require timely solutions. In this article, various avenues available for TinyML implementation are reviewed. Firstly, a background of TinyML is provided, followed by detailed discussions on various tools supporting TinyML. Then, state-of-art applications of TinyML using advanced technologies are detailed. Lastly, detailed prospects are presented which include various research challenges and identification of future directions.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

       "</xhtml:head><xhtml:body><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Autonomous systems are machines that can alter their behavior without direct human oversight or control. How ought we to program them to behave? A plausible starting point is given by the Reduction to Acts Thesis, according to which we ought to program autonomous systems to do whatever a human agent ought to do in the same circumstances. Although the Reduction to Acts Thesis is initially appealing, we argue that it is false: it is sometimes permissible to program a machine to do something that it would be wrong for a human to do. We advance two main arguments for this claim. First, the way an autonomous system will behave can be known in advance. This knowledge can indirectly affect the behavior of other agents, while the same may not be true at the time the system actually executes its programming. Second, a lack of knowledge of the identities of the victims and beneficiaries can provide a justification during the programming phase that would be unavailable to an agent at the time the autonomous system executes its programming.</p></xhtml:body></pam:message><pam:message xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:pam=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/pam/2.0/\" xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><xhtml:head>\n",

There is a need for a revision of mechanisms to address discrimination in light of the unique challenges presented by these systems, which are not easily auditable or explainable. Research efforts to bring fairness to ADM solutions should be viewed as a matter of justice and trust among actors should be ensured through technology design. Ideas that move us to explore the notions of justice within the field of political thinking, aiming to identify the elements that frame the social context of the discriminatory decisions produced by algorithmic decision-making solutions.

      " Future broad application paradigms like beyond-5G (B5G), 6G and super-Internet of things (IoT) will bring significant disruption in all the segments of the physical infrastructure ensuring such services, from the core (cloud) to the edge of the network. Substantial rearchitecting will be necessary to allow proper functioning of a highly-diversified space-air-ground-sea physical infrastructure, along with operation at frequency ranges spanning from sub-GHz, to millimeter-waves (mm-Waves), again to sub-THz (100–300 GHz) and above. In this work, we focus on the radio frequency (RF) portion of the infrastructure, and in particular on micro-relays for channel commuting and reconfiguration of passive elements. To this end, we report on high-performance and highly-miniaturized micro-switches based on microelectromechanical-systems (MEMS) technology, known as RF-MEMS. A few different design concepts of RF-MEMS-based series ohmic switches are reported, discussed and compared, with the support of finite element method (FEM) modeling and RF experimental characterization up to 110 GHz. \n",

      " The lightning-fast development of artificial intelligence and neural networks in general has had a tremendous impact on many different fields, and biological engineering is only one of those fields. These innovations have the potential to completely revolutionize the field of medicine by enhancing diagnostics, treatment planning, and tailored medication. This might be accomplished. However, there are ethical and legal concerns about the manner in which they should be incorporated into biomedicine. This study's objective is to investigate the existing legal frameworks that regulate the uses of artificial intelligence and neural networks in biomedical engineering and to evaluate how effectively such frameworks address the challenges posed by technological inclusion. On a global, regional, and national basis, we evaluated the rules and regulations that regulate the use of artificial intelligence and neural networks in biomedical engineering. These laws and regulations control the field. According to the findings of our research, even if the current legal frameworks have been improved in some respects, substantial problems are still present. These problems are particularly prevalent in the areas of data privacy, algorithmic responsibility, and ethical dilemmas. Also, the article discusses the need of doing ongoing evaluations and making adjustments in order to keep up with the fast advancement of artificial intelligence and neural networks in the area of biomedical engineering. \n",

      " Flexible manufacturing systems in high-mix low-volume segments offer many challenges in terms of planning and scheduling. The complexity of these systems often requires a systemic approach for which humans are the perfect actors. However, computer systems can support scheduling tasks more effectively due to their capacity to synthesize large amounts of data. This paper describes a system developed for the flexible manufacturing of wooden doors with a wide range of product configurations. This paper proposes a rule-based scheduling method for high-mix production. The method was applied and validated at a wooden door producer. Based on the company's production schedule for a given week, a scheduling program was developed that suggested minor rearrangements for production leveling. As the rule-based approach makes the decisions verifiable, the program was validated at the producer, through a case study of production leveling under volume constraints. The results include the complete elimination of changeovers and the stabilization of throughput, which improved the precision of the delivery time. The producer is integrating the program into their production planning and control system. Thus, the results suggest that the proposed method can be useful for scheduling high-mix low-volume production, and merits further validation in similar environments. \n",

      " Due to the demographic developments of an increasingly aging society, the number of employees retiring is also rising. Likewise, the fluctuation within the individual companies has increased drastically within the last few years. As a result, experience gained over many years is being lost. On the other hand, there is a strong trend towards an ever-increasing number of very complex manufacturing processes with a large number of process influencing variables, where the human monitoring capabilities are limited. In this work we study the complex process of hot stamping of metal blanks for car body parts with a demonstrator plant. The demonstrator plant consists of five main components, comprising a magazine for material feed, an industrial robot for transferring the raw material and the finished part, an annealing furnace, and a hydraulic press with the temperature controlled hot forming tool inside. All machines have open communication interfaces with which all sensor data can be accessed. The demonstrator plant is additionally outfitted with different sensors measuring crucial process parameters. We use temperature sensors in the punch and die and make use of capturing the structure-borne sound and mechanical vibrations during the process to closely monitor the process. This sensor data is analyzed and methods of machine learning are used to detect anomalies in the process data. The goal of this work is to develop a methodology for the systematic detection of anomalies in the hot forming process using machine learning methods within a demonstrator plant that are suitable for real time anomaly detection for a high level control system. We use unsupervised machine learning techniques and neural networks to detect anomalies with great accuracy on our test data. \n",

      " AI chatbots are possessing significant importance due to the advent of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence. They are used in many industries to interact with customers, respond to frequently asked inquiries, and carry out specific duties for which they were designed. More AI enabled chatbots are being used in the tourism industry to provide better customer service to the travellers. In the literature review, researches relating to adoption of AI chatbots in tourism are scarce. The paper extends the UTAUT2 model and examines the aspects that impact consumer adoption of AI chatbots in the travel and tourism segment. We used a quantitative research approach and the data was collected through online surveys. A total of 466 responses were collected from frequent travellers. Partial least square approach was utilized to do the data analysis. The emanating outcome of this research study divulge the aspects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, habit, personal innovativeness, and awareness of chatbot service optimistically influenced the behavioural intention to make use of AI chatbots for tourism services. Awareness of service also indirectly influenced intention to use through performance and effort expectancies. This paper offers unique insights for executives, practitioners, and employees at managerial level in the tourism sector, along with system designers and creators of AI chatbot technologies. \n",

      " In recent years, the massive development of digital technologies for capturing data from sensors, located both in-side buildings and in the urban environment, made necessary an expansion of the traditional semantic domains of the construction industry with reference to BIM-based information management processes. The integration of data between BIM models and IoT devices enables the creation of Digital Twins (DTs) of built heritage assets, capable of connecting data coming continuously from sensors with digital models of those assets. This enables the management of large masses of data produced at various stages of the building lifecycle, making it possible to experiment with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics for predictive analysis of building system behavior and performance. This paper presents the results of a research, which aimed to develop a methodological and operational workflow for the creation of Digital Twin of buildings. The interoperability offered by the IFC schema allowed the use of an external platform for linking different semantic fields. Thus, on the one hand, a federated BIM model was created, and on the other hand, real-time acquired data from a system of sensors in-stalled at different locations in the building were recorded and stored in a central server. \n",

      " The recent COVID-19 pandemic has served as a timely reminder that the existing drug discovery is a laborious, expensive, and slow process. Never has there been such global demand for a therapeutic treatment to be identified as a matter of such urgency. Unfortunately, this is a scenario likely to repeat itself in future, so it is of interest to explore ways in which to accelerate drug discovery at pandemic speed. Computational methods naturally lend themselves to this because they can be performed rapidly if sufficient computational resources are available. Recently, high-performance computing (HPC) technologies have led to remarkable achievements in computational drug discovery and yielded a series of new platforms, algorithms, and workflows. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches is also a promising and relatively new avenue to revolutionize the drug design process and therefore reduce costs. In this review, I describe how molecular dynamics simulations (MD) were successfully integrated with ML and adapted to HPC to form a powerful tool to study inhibitors for four of the COVID-19 target proteins. The emphasis of this review is on the strategy that was used with an explanation of each of the steps in the accelerated drug discovery workflow. For specific technical details, the reader is directed to the relevant research publications. \n",

      " Cyber-physical systems and Industry-4.0 have made smart manufacturing possible. The multi-national companies were able to quickly adapt and cope with changing times, but the micro small-scale enterprises (m-SMEs) were at crossroads to adopt new technology due to extensive costs involved. This gap of no existing solutions for micro-SMEs is the result of literature survey for this work. Then the COVID-19 pandemic made it extremely difficult for micro-SMEs to survive. This paper implements a smart manufacturing solution for production facility at one such micro-SME. Pre-pandemic, their facility had enough production to satisfy the demand, but pandemic overwhelmed their production with rapid rise in demand. The main goal for this study is to make the micro-SME cope this unprecedented rise in demand. The production facility was upgraded, and smart features were incorporated based on cyber-physical production systems framework to predict demand and transform a manual manufacturing into smart manufacturing. With more than one product being produced, optimum production was achieved avoiding over/underproduction for different products given the limited storage capacity available with the micro-SMEs. \n",

Artificial intelligence technology has a deep impact on different disciplines and can improve the efficiency of architectural skin design and inspire architects. In order to find new expressions of the building skin, it is necessary to focus on the dialogue between the architectural skin and the environment, and to innovate by breaking away from the patterned and formalized design. This work combines the development of artificial intelligence to initially explore the role of neural style transfer for architectural skin design, where the fusion of different styles of architectural images is programmed to generate another style, thus allowing architects to make clearer decisions and judgments. After performing neural style migration on five different types of buildings, the results obtained can present the new style form more completely, which provides new ideas and inspiration for the application of artificial intelligence in architectural design. \n",

      " Brazil, despite its recent advances in the regulatory sphere for Privacy and Data Protection, still remains unregulated regarding the use of artificial intelligence. In 2020, two years after the enactment of the General Law on Data Protection (LGPD), a Bill emerged that was the first Brazilian attempt not only to regulate, but also to define, classify, and identify AI-powered tools. However, among confusing meanings and vague typifications, the proposal failed to become the prototype that would generate a regulatory framework that encompasses both preventive compliance methods and possible remedial solutions for eventual disputes. Thus, the need emerges to seek pre-existing solutions in the Brazilian legislation that, although still undefined and precariously implemented, may be consolidated in the future as indispensable tools for the identification of eventual failures. This is where the mandatory implementation of the impact assessment comes in as a potential solution for the detailed analysis of AI-powered systems. Software architectures that are programmed to make automated decisions by means of machine learning techniques, for example, present certain risks, but the level of risk is unknown, precisely because of the lack of transparency about how their internal architectures work. Thus, a continuous and properly documented risk assessment will provide essential analysis both to substantiate a preventive system that survives the wear and tear of time in relation to inexorable technological advancement, and to serve as a broad and precise regulation, which will work as a legal instrument for any legal dispute that may arise in the years to come. \n",

      " The advancements in artificial intelligence are triggering discussions on transforming many processes in the industry, society or economy, including the healthcare sector. The new capabilities offered by emerging technologies applied in healthcare help deliver more accurate and efficient diagnoses and treatment options. Artificial intelligence models can be used for various purposes in healthcare, from functions such as personal assistant, up to analyzing data and providing recommendations for tasks such as medical imaging analysis, drug development, disease identification, and emergency support. Furthermore, artificial intelligence models can support research actions, to speed up the development of certain cures or medicines. They can also assist in detecting high-risk conditions in patients, discovering and researching new drugs and medicines, and developing new treatment plans. However, these digital technologies come with cybersecurity risks, both due to the underlying technical systems, such as computers used, up to the risks or issues in the models themselves, which can lead to questions on the accuracy of the recommendations and solutions provided by the models, or data breaches and cyber-attacks. Such incidents can lead to serious consequences, including compromised data privacy and safety. This paper presents some potential use cases of the AI model in the healthcare industry. In addition, several cyber security recommendations are offered to ensure that the adoption and use of such emerging tools minimize potential cyber risks. \n",

      " It is a challenging task to teach machines to paint like human artists in a stroke-by-stroke fashion. Despite advances in stroke-based image rendering and deep learning-based image rendering, existing painting methods have limitations: they (i) lack flexibility to choose different art-style strokes, (ii) lose content details of images, and (iii) generate few artistic styles for paintings. In this paper, we propose a stroke-style generative adversarial network, called Stroke-GAN, to solve the first two limitations. Stroke-GAN learns styles of strokes from different stroke-style datasets, so can produce diverse stroke styles. We design three players in Stroke-GAN to generate pure-color strokes close to human artists’ strokes, thereby improving the quality of painted details. To overcome the third limitation, we have devised a neural network named Stroke-GAN Painter, based on Stroke-GAN; it can generate different artistic styles of paintings. Experiments demonstrate that our artful painter can generate various styles of paintings while well-preserving content details (such as details of human faces and building textures) and retaining high fidelity to the input images. \n",

      " Medical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have consistently shown remarkable performance in providing medical professionals and patients with support for complex tasks. Nevertheless, the use of these applications in sensitive clinical domains where high-stakes decisions are involved could be much more extensive if patients, medical professionals, and regulators were provided with mechanisms for trusting the results provided by AI systems. A key issue for achieving this is endowing AI systems with key dimensions of Trustworthy AI (TAI), such as fairness, transparency, robustness, or accountability, which are not usually considered within this context in a generalized and systematic manner. This paper reviews the recent advances in the TAI domain, including TAI standards and guidelines. We propose several requirements to be addressed in the design, development, and deployment of TAI systems and present a novel machine learning pipeline that contains TAI requirements as embedded components. Moreover, as an example of how current AI systems in medicine consider the TAI perspective, the study extensively reviews the recent literature (2017–2021) on AI systems in a prevalent and high social-impact disease: diagnosis and progression detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The most relevant AI systems in the AD domain are compared and discussed (such as machine learning, deep learning, ensembles, time series, and multimodal multitask) from the perspective of how they address TAI in their design. Several open challenges are highlighted, which could be claimed as one of the main reasons to justify the rare application of AI systems in real clinical environments. The study provides a roadmap to measure the TAI status of an AI systems and highlights its limitations. In addition, it provides the main guidelines to overcome these limitations and build medically trusted AI-based applications in the medical domain. \n",

The main objective is to design an intelligent tool to forecast the directional movement of stock market prices based on financial time series and news headlines as inputs. The binary predicted output obtained using the proposed model would aid investors in making better decisions.

      " The aim of our study is to validate a totally automated deep learning (DL)-based segmentation pipeline to screen abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans. We retrospectively evaluated 73 thoraco-abdominal CTAs (48 AAA and 25 control CTA) by means of a DL-based segmentation pipeline built on a 2.5D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to segment lumen and thrombus of the aorta. The maximum aortic diameter of the abdominal tract was compared using a threshold value (30 mm). Blinded manual measurements from a radiologist were done in order to create a true comparison. The screening pipeline was tested on 48 patients with aneurysm and 25 without aneurysm. The average diameter manually measured was 51.1 ± 14.4 mm for patients with aneurysms and 21.7 ± 3.6 mm for patients without aneurysms. The pipeline correctly classified 47 AAA out of 48 and 24 control patients out of 25 with 97% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 96% specificity. The automated pipeline of aneurysm measurements in the abdominal tract reported a median error with regard to the maximum abdominal diameter measurement of 1.3 mm. Our approach allowed for the maximum diameter of 51.2 ± 14.3 mm in patients with aneurysm and 22.0 ± 4.0 mm in patients without an aneurysm. The DL-based screening for AAA is a feasible and accurate method, calling for further validation using a larger pool of diagnostic images towards its clinical use. \n",

      " The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed various domains, including education. Generative AI models have garnered significant attention for their potential in educational settings, but image-generative AI models need to be more utilized. This study explores the potential of integrating generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, into art-focused STEAM classes. To this end, we combined STEAM education with image-generative AI. We designed and implemented a learning activity in which students used image-generative AI to generate creative images and wrote imaginative diaries inspired by AI-generated pictures. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected and analyzed data from surveys, interviews, and prompt datasets to gain insights into students' perceptions, motivations, and behaviors concerning the integration of generative AI in art education. Our study found that incorporating generative AI into art-focused STEAM classes may reduce the gap between male and female students' interest in art practices. We also found that the number of subjects in students' prompt datasets is linked to their divergent and convergent thinking. Finally, we discovered a meaningful correlation between the number of unique words in students' diaries and the image scores that researchers assessed. Our findings shed light on the relationship between students' divergent and convergent behaviors, offering valuable insights into their creative thinking processes. This study underscores the potential of integrating image-generative AI models in STEAM education. \n",

      " This paper proposes a Reconfigurable In-Memory Advance Computing architecture using a novel 10 SRAM cell. In addition to basic logic operations, the proposed R-InMAC can also implement complex Boolean computing operations such as binary addition/subtraction, binary-to-gray, gray-to-binary conversion, 2’s complement, less/greater than, and increment/decrement. Furthermore, content addressable memory (CAM) operation to search a binary string in a memory array is also proposed efficiently. It can search true and complementary data strings in a single cycle. The proposed R-InMAC architecture’s reconfigurability allows it to be configured according to the needed operation and bit precision, making it ideal and energy-efficient. In addition, compared to the standard SRAM cells, the proposed 10T cell is suited for implementing the XNOR-based binary convolution operation required in Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) with improved latency of 58.89%. The optimized full adder of the proposed R-InMAC shows decrement in the area by 40%, static power by 28%, dynamic power by 55.2%, and latency by 25.3% as compared to conventional designs, making this work a promising candidate for modern edge AI compute in-memory systems.\n",

      " Artificial intelligence (AI) developments enable human capability to deliver the same outcome at a lower cost. This research performs a high-level matching between AI solutions and challenges within the port area by developing a novel academic approach. This way, the matching is carried out more structured than when one (manager, developer, challenge owner, etc.) fulfils it based on their opinion without following any structured approach. Therefore, the study defines first a comprehensive typology of port stakeholders' challenges, which can be solved via AI solutions. This typology presents challenges, including their main issues, widespread impact, and potential solutions. A state-of-the-art review of AI solutions that can address these challenges is carried out in parallel. Secondly, this review clearly distinguishes between AI solutions based on their technology and functionality. Thirdly, this research selects an appropriate AI solution for addressing each identified challenge in the port operation by upgrading the Gale–Shapley algorithm. Finally, it shows that the most critical presented AI solutions in this study use various machine learning (ML) techniques. Besides, concerning the AI solution's reusability feature and the result of high-level matching, this research shows that the implementation phase effort can be drastically reduced by using the recently developed matching algorithm. \n",

      " Singularitarianism is a view that is grounded in certain claims about the technological singularity. In this paper, I identify a trilemma that confronts singularitarianism. This trilemma may be characterized in terms of the following horns: the concept of a technological singularity having a literal sense, the concept of a technological singularity having a metaphorical sense, and the concept of a technological singularity having neither a literal nor a metaphorical sense (i.e., its being nonsensical). I will outline the unpalatable consequences that are associated with each of these three horns of the trilemma. I will also anticipate a few argumentative moves on behalf of singularitarianism and suggest why these moves may be insufficient. I will conclude by arguing that we have good philosophical grounds to defend an eliminativism about the concept of the technological singularity. \n",

      " One of the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 is to keep the unemployment rate at the lowest level to empower the economy. Prior research has shown that an increase in unemployment has a negative effect on a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This paper aims to utilise cutting-edge technology such as Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist the Saudi labour market by matching job seekers with vacant positions. Currently, human experts carry out this process; however, this is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Moreover, in the Saudi labour market, this process does not use a cohesive data centre to monitor, integrate or analyse labour-market data, resulting in several inefficiencies, such as bias and latency. These inefficiencies arise from a lack of technologies and, more importantly, from having an open labour-market without a national data centre. This paper proposes a new AI Recruiting Model (AIRM) architecture that exploits DLs, ML and AI to rapidly and efficiently match job seekers to vacant positions in the Saudi labour market. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is employed to test the proposed AIRM architecture using a labour market dataset simulation corpus for training purposes; the architecture is further evaluated against three research collaborators who are all professionals in Human Resources (HR). As this research is data-driven in nature, it requires collaboration from domain experts. The first layer of the AIRM architecture uses balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH) as a clustering algorithm for the initial screening layer. The mapping layer uses sentence transformers with a robustly optimised BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) as the base model, and ranking is carried out using the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). Finally, the preferences layer takes the user’s preferences as a list and sorts the results using the pre-trained cross-encoders model, considering the weight of the more important words. This new AIRM has yielded favourable outcomes: This research considered accepting an AIRM selection ratified by at least one HR expert to account for the subjective character of the selection process when exclusively handled by human HR experts. The research evaluated the AIRM using two metrics: accuracy and time. The AIRM had an overall matching accuracy of 84%, with at least one expert agreeing with the system’s output. Furthermore, it completed the task in 2.4 min, whereas human experts took more than 6 days on average. Overall, the AIRM outperforms humans in task execution, making it useful in pre-selecting a group of applicants and positions. The AIRM is not limited to government services. It can also help any commercial business that uses Big Data. \n",

      " Wildfires are among the most threatening hazards to life, property, well-being, and the environment. Studying public opinions about wildfires can help monitor the perception of the impacted communities. Nevertheless, wildfire research is relatively limited compared to other climate-related hazards. This article presents our data mining work on public opinions about wildfires in Australia from 2014 to 2021. Three key aspects are analyzed: the topic of concern, sentiment polarization, and perceived emotions. We propose a data filtering approach to acquire golden samples to train a supervised model for emotion quantification to achieve the last target. The results show that the new model produces a more accurate emotion estimation than the existing lexicon approach. Through data analysis, we find that people have seen wildfires as one of the impacts of climate change; trends of tweets can reflect the damage of wildfires in real life. \n",

      " Personality describes an individual’s internal attributes, encompassing distinctive thoughts, emotions, and behaviour. Various studies have been undertaken to quantify these personality traits using externally visible cues and measures. Despite the possibility of a disparity between the apparent and real personality traits, researchers have identified various deep learning techniques to measure the apparent personality as part of the ChaLearn Looking at People, ECCV challenge. We provide an overview of the different deep learning models used for apparent personality detection. The primary objective of previous studies was to develop highly accurate prediction models, and subsequently, the focus shifted towards interpreting the output of these techniques. Although explainable AI (XAI) techniques have shown that facial features are essential in predicting personality, the consistency of these results is still a critical factor to consider. Moreover, the majority of studies utilized the ECCV challenge CVPR’17 dataset to predict apparent personality; therefore, there is a requirement to validate these findings through additional datasets. In conclusion, ample scope exists for further research in the domain of personality detection that can yield highly accurate and more interpretable models.\n",

      " Dimension reductions (DR) help people make sense of image collections by organizing images in the 2D space based on similarities. However, they provide little support for explaining why images were placed together or apart in the 2D space. Additionally, they do not provide support for modifying and updating the 2D representation to explore new relationships and organizations of images. To address these problems, we present an interactive DR method for images that uses visual features extracted by a deep neural network to project the images into 2D space and provides visual explanations of image features that contributed to the 2D location. In addition, it allows people to directly manipulate the 2D projection space to define alternative relationships and explore subsequent projections of the images. With an iterative cycle of semantic interaction and explainable-AI feedback, people can explore complex visual relationships in image data. Our approach to human–AI interaction integrates visual knowledge from both human-mental models and pre-trained deep neural models to explore image data. We demonstrate our method through examples with collaborators in agricultural science and other applications. Additionally, we present a quantitative evaluation that assesses how well our method captures and incorporates feedback.\n",

      " Currently, there is a significant amount of research being conducted in the field of artificial intelligence to improve the explainability and interpretability of deep learning models. It is found that if end-users understand the reason for the production of some output, it is easier to trust the system. Recommender systems are one example of systems that great efforts have been conducted to make their output more explainable. One method for producing a more explainable output is using counterfactual reasoning, which involves altering minimal features to generate a counterfactual item that results in changing the output of the system. This process allows the identification of input features that have a significant impact on the desired output, leading to effective explanations. In this paper, we present a method for generating counterfactual explanations for both tabular and textual features. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method on three real-world datasets and demonstrated a +5% improvement on finding effective features (based on model-based measures) compared to the baseline method. \n",

      " Social media has revolutionized the way information is distributed throughout society, as folks continue to rely entirely on these apps for information on current events, health protocols, and socio-political discussions. However, these containers of knowledge do not appear in the same shape for every user; Algorithms, informed by capitalist agendas, determine what information sifts through its networks and to whom. Data scientists, researchers, and activists have dissected the hidden mechanics fueling these popular platforms, inciting critical conversations around the harmful biases embedded in algorithms. These studies often skim the surface of how these algorithms digitally marginalize people of color, if acknowledging it at all. Even fewer have attempted to examine the role these algorithms play in the social activism and digital community organizing happening amongst communities of color via social media. Referring to indigenous scholar Marisa Elena Duarte’s book Network Sovereignty as a framework of thought, this paper roots itself in the notion that technology is an extension of the agenda utilizing it. Through dissecting the algorithmic structures of popular social platforms among communities of color, this paper examines how social media distributes information within its networks and how its encoded biases silence Black, brown, and indigenous voices. This paper also provides insight into how BIPOC content-creators, when informed on how the algorithms work, can use these platforms to their advantage and effectively facilitate socio-political discourse online; Changing the narrative of social networks from being yet another landscape of white supremacy to instead a communal canvas for radical change. \n",

      " The term ‘artificial intelligence’ has arguably come to function in political discourse as, what Laclau called, an ‘empty signifier’. This article traces the shifting political discourse on AI within three key institutions of global governance–OHCHR, WHO, and UNESCO–and, in so doing, highlights the role of ‘crisis’ moments in justifying a series of pivotal re-articulations. Most important has been the attachment of AI to the narrative around digital automation in human healthcare. Greatly enabled by the societal context of the pandemic, all three institutions have moved from being critical of the unequal power relations in the economy of AI to, today, reframing themselves primarily as facilitators tasked with helping to ensure the application of AI technologies. The analysis identifies a shift in which human health and healthcare is framed as in a ‘crisis’ to which AI technology is presented as the remedy. The article argues the need to trace these discursive shifts as a means by which to understand, monitor, and where necessary also hold to account these changes in the governance of AI in society. \n",

      " The introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI has stimulated substantial discourse on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains such as academia, business, and society at large. Although AI has been utilized in numerous areas for several years, the emergence of generative AI (GAI) applications such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or DALL-E are considered a breakthrough for the acceleration of AI technology due to their ease of use, intuitive interface, and performance. With GAI, it is possible to create a variety of content such as texts, images, audio, code, and even videos. This creates a variety of implications for businesses requiring a deeper examination, including an influence on business model innovation (BMI). Therefore, this study provides a BMI perspective on GAI with two primary contributions: (1) The development of six comprehensive propositions outlining the impact of GAI on businesses, and (2) the discussion of three industry examples, specifically software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. This study employs a qualitative content analysis using a scoping review methodology, drawing from a wide-ranging sample of 513 data points. These include academic publications, company reports, and public information such as press releases, news articles, interviews, and podcasts. The study thus contributes to the growing academic discourse in management research concerning AI's potential impact and offers practical insights into how to utilize this technology to develop new or improve existing business models. \n",

      " Modern machine learning methods allow for complex and in-depth analytics, but the predictive models generated by these methods are often highly complex and lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are used to improve the interpretability of these complex “black box” models, thereby increasing transparency and enabling informed decision-making. However, the inherent fitness of these explainable methods, particularly the faithfulness of explanations to the decision-making processes of the model, can be hard to evaluate. In this work, we examine and evaluate the explanations provided by four XAI methods, using fully transparent “glass box” models trained on tabular data. Our results suggest that the fidelity of explanations is determined by the types of variables used, as well as the linearity of the relationship between variables and model prediction. We find that each XAI method evaluated has its own strengths and weaknesses, determined by the assumptions inherent in the explanation mechanism. Thus, though such methods are model-agnostic, we find significant differences in explanation quality across different technical setups. Given the numerous factors that determine the quality of explanations, including the specific explanation-generation procedures implemented by XAI methods, we suggest that model-agnostic XAI methods may still require expert guidance for implementation. \n",

Particularly, existing proposals to define GPAIS do not provide sufficient guidance to distinguish these systems from those designed to perform specific tasks, denominated as fixed-purpose. Thus, our working paper has three objectives: first, to highlight the variance and ambiguity in the interpretation of GPAIS in the literature; second, to examine the dimensions of the generality of purpose available to define GPAIS; lastly, to propose a functional definition of the term that facilitates its governance within the EU. Our intention with this piece is to offer policymakers an alternative perspective on GPAIS that improves the hard and soft law efforts to mitigate these systems’ risks and protect the well-being and future of constituencies in the EU and globally. \n",

The absence of a valid and reliable measure of responsible AI (RAI) has stunted the growth of organizational research on RAI (i.e., the organizational balancing act to optimize efficiency and equity). To address this void, we develop a novel measurement instrument to assess RAI maturity in firms. A review of the nascent literature reveals that there is a wide distribution of RAI capabilities. The RAI instrument that we advance is based on the exhaustive review of this dispersed literature.
