The Character of Physical Law	The Messenger Lectures at Cornell University were instituted in 1924 by Hiram J. Messenger ‘to provide a course or courses of lectures on the evolution of civilization for the special purpose of raising the moral standard of our political, business and social life’. In November 1964, Feynman gave seven lectures, extempore with the help of brief notes, on ‘The Character of Physical Law’. The transcripts were prepared and published by BBC in 1965.	2018
The Law of Peoples	One aim of this essay is to sketch in a short space-I can do no more than that-how the law of peoples may be developed out of liberal ideas of justice similar to but more general than the idea I called justice as fairness and presented in my book A Theory of Justice.' By the law of peoples I mean a political conception of right and justice that applies to the principles and norms of international law and practice.2 In section 58 of the	1993
Zipf's Law for Cities: An Explanation	Zipf ’s law is a very tight constraint on the class of admissible models of local growth. It says that for most countries the size distribution of cities strikingly fits a power law: the number of cities with populations greater than S is proportional to 1/S. Suppose that, at least in the upper tail, all cities follow some proportional growth process (this appears to be verified empirically). This automatically leads their distribution to converge to Zipf ’s law.	1999

On Law and Justice	This book is a classic work of twentieth-century legal philosophy. The first translation into English was notably poor and misrepresented the views expressed in the text. Translated from scratch from the original Danish, this new critical edition casts light on the work and resituates it firmly in the context of current debates in the field. In recent years, Alf Ross (1899–1979) has attracted increasing attention. In H. L. A. Hart’s words, he was ‘the most acute and best-equipped philosopher’ of Scandinavian legal realism. This book provides a comprehensive outline of Ross’s legal realist position, outlining a consistently empirical research programme that simultaneously recognizes the distinctly normative character of law. On the basis of a sophisticated analysis of the concept ‘scientifically valid law’, Ross’s legal realism avoids the standard critiques against behaviourist reductionism while still remaining categorically distinct from legal positivism and natural law.	2019
A Brief History of Generative Models for Power Law and Lognormal Distributions	Recently, I became interested in a current debate over whether file size distributions are best modelled by a power law distribution or a lognormal distribution. In trying to learn enough about these distributions to settle the question, I found a rich and long history, spanning many fields. Indeed, several recently proposed models from the computer science community have antecedents in work from decades ago. Here, I briefly survey some of this history, focusing on underlying generative models that lead to these distributions. One finding is that lognormal and power law distributions connect quite naturally, and hence, it is not surprising that lognormal distributions have arisen as a possible alternative to power law distributions across many fields.	2004
Exploitation Creep and the Unmaking of Human Trafficking Law	Over the last fifteen years, the problem of human trafficking has become a focus of government and advocacy agendas worldwide. Increasingly referred to as “modern-day slavery,” the phenomenon has prompted rapid proliferation of international, regional, and national anti-trafficking laws, and inspired states to devote enormous financial and bureaucratic resources to its eradication. It has also spawned an industry of nonprofits that have elevated the “abolition” of trafficking into a pressing moral campaign, which anyone can join with the click of a mouse. Scholars have also jumped into the fray, calling on states to marshal human rights law, tax law, trade law, tort law, public health law, labor law, and even military might to combat this apparently growing international crime and human rights violation.	2014
The Force of Law: Toward a Sociology of the Juridical Field	"Pierre Bourdieu holds the Chair in Sociology at the prestigious College de France, Paris. He is Directeur d'Etudes at l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, where he is also Director of the Center for European Sociology, and Editor of the influential journal Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales. Professor Bourdieu is the author or coauthor of approximately twenty books. A number of these have been published in English translation: The Algerians, 1962; Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture (with Jean-Claude Passeron), 1977; Outline of a Theory of Practice, 1977; Algeria I960, 1979; The Inheritors: French Students and their Relations to Culture, 1979; Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, 1984. The essay below analyzes what Bourdieu terms the ""juridical field."" In Bourdieu's conception, a ""field"" is an area of structured, socially patterned activity or ""practice,"" in this case disciplinarily and professionally defined. The ""field"" and its ""practices"" have special senses in"	1987

Compilation of Henry’s law constants	Many atmospheric chemicals occur in the gas phase as well as in liquid cloud droplets and aerosol particles. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the distribution between the phases. According to Henry’s law, the equilibrium ratio between the abundances in the gas phase and in the aqueous phase is constant for a dilute solution. Henry’s law constants of trace gases of potential importance in environmental chemistry have been collected and converted into a uniform format. The compilation contains 17092 values of Henry’s law constants for 4628 species, collected from 672 references. It is also available on the internet at http://www.henrys-law.org.	2015
